$       RIGID FORMAT No. 10, Complex Eigenvalue Analysis - Modal Formulation
$                   Rocket Guidance and Control Problem (10-1-1)
$ 
$ A. Description
$ 
$ This problem, although a simplified model, contains all of the elements used
$ in a linear control system analysis. The flexible structure consists of three
$ sections: two sections are constructed of structural finite elements; the
$ third section is formulated in terms of its modal coordinates. A sensor is
$ located at an arbitrary point on the structure and connected to a structural
$ point with multipoint constraints. The measured attitude and position of the
$ sensor point is used to generate a control voltage for the gimbal angle of the
$ thrust nozzle. The nozzle control is in itself a servomechanism consisting of
$ an amplifier, a motor, and a position and velocity feedback control. The
$ nozzle produces a force on the structure due to its mass and the angle of
$ thrust. The motion of any point on the structure is dependent on the elastic
$ motions, free-body notions, and large angle effects due to free-body rotation.
$ 
$ The definitions for the variables and coefficients along with values for the
$ coefficients are given in Table 1. The use of the Transfer Function data card
$ (TF) allows the direct definition of the various relations.
$ 
$ B. Theory
$ 
$ A section of the structure is defined by its modaI coordinates by using a
$ modification of the method given in the NASTRAN Theoretical Manual. The
$ algorithm is given as follows:
$ 
$ Define  xi , i = 1, n  - modal deflections scalar points
$           i
$                   u    - grid point components used as nonredundant
$                    r     supports for modal test. These may or may not be
$                          connected to the rest of the structure.
$ 
$                   u    - grid point components to be connected to the
$                    c     remaining structure (not u  points)
$                                                    r
$ 
$         x   i = 1, n   - rigid body component degrees of freedom for the
$          i               nonzero nodes
$ 
$ The relations between these variables are defined by using multipoint
$ constraints with the following relationships:
$ 
$    {u }  =  [phi  ]{xi } + [D  ]{u }                                       (1)
$      c          ci    i      cr   r
$ 
$ where phi   is the angular deflection of point u  for mode i. D   is the
$          ci                                     c              cr
$ deflection of point u  when the structure is rigid and point u  is given a
$                      c                                        r
$ unit deflection.

$    {x }  =  [K ]  [H] {u }  =  [G]{u }                                     (2)
$      i        i         r           r
$ 
$ where [K ] is a diagonal matrix. Each term K , the modal stiffness, is defined
$         i                                   i
$ as:
$ 
$              2
$    K   =  m w                      (w  not equal 0)                        (3)
$     i      i i                       i
$ 
$ where m  is the modal mass and w  is the natural frequency in radians per
$        i                        i
$ second. [H] is determined by the forces on the support points due to each
$ nonzero eigenvector:
$ 
$    P   =  - sum from i H   xi      (w  not equal 0)                        (4)
$     r                   ri   i       i
$ 
$ The structure to be added in this problem consists of a simply supported
$ uniform bed. The support points, u , are y   and y  . The additional degree of
$                                   r       16      19

$ The determinant of the matrix forms a polynomial of order 10. The roots of
$ this polynomial were obtained by a standard computer library routine and are
$ presented in Table 2 as the analytical results. The rigid body solution is
$ also presented.
$ 
$ The differences between the two sets of answers is due to the differences in
$ models. The NASTRAN model produces errors due to the finite difference
$ approximation and the number of modes chosen to model the third stage. The
$ polynomial solution produces errors due to the approximations used in the
$ equations of motion as applied to control system problems.
$ 
$ As a further check the first eigenvalue (lambda = -1.41) was substituted into
$ the matrix and the matrix was normalized by dividing each row by its diagonal
$ value. The NASTRAN eigenvector was multiplied by the matrix, resulting in an
$ error vector which theoretically should be zero. Dividing each term in the
$ error vector by its corresponding term in the eigenvector resulted in very
$ small error ratios.
