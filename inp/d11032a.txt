$        Jet Transport Wing Dynamic Analysis, Frequency Response (11-3-1)
$        Jet Transport Wing Dynamic Analysis, Transient Response (11-3-2)
$ 
$ A. Description
$ 
$ This example illustrates the use of the aeroelastic response analysis to
$ perform frequency, random, and transient response calculations for a structure
$ excited by aerodynamic loadings. This problem is also discussed in Section
$ 1.11.5 of the User's Manual.
$ 
$ For this demonstration problem, the aileron is locked and the fuselage to
$ which the wing is attached is a rigid body represented by grid point 11. Only
$ out-of-plane motions are retained in the model. The wing is modeled with GENEL
$ data defining the flexibility matrix, [Z], and a free-body matrix, [S]. The
$ aileron also is modeled as a rigid body with the hinge line at point 8. The
$ vertical flap deflection at point 12 is defined by an MPC equation.
$ 
$ The aerodynamic model consists of 42 doublet lattice aerodynamic boxes,
$ forming one coupled group. Three CAERO1 aerodynamic elements are used to
$ define the areas of uniform mesh on the wing. The aerodynamic degrees of
$ freedom, implicitly defined by the CAERO data, are coupled to the structure
$ with surface splines defined on SPLINE2 data cards.
$ 
$ B. Input
$ 
$ Two separate analyses are performed with this structural model. Problem 11-3-1
$ performs a frequency response analysis for a smooth gust shape and generates
$ spectral density output plots for a random gust magnitude. Problem 11-3-2
$ produces a transient response solution using a Fourier transform of the
$ frequency response solution.
