                         /ZZZZZZ/ IS USED FOR ALLOCATING OPEN CORE AND SPACE FOR THE IN-MEMORY           
                         DATA BASE.  THE SIZE OF COMMON /ZZZZZZ/ IS DEFINED IN ./MDS/NASTRN.F

                         ALLOCATING OPEN CORE IS USED FOR THE IN-MEMORY DATA BASE.  THE USER             
                         CONTROLS THE ALLOCATION OF OPEN CORE THROUGH THE NASTRAN MENU.  THE             
                         USER CAN ELIMINATE THE USE OF THE IN-MEMORY DATA BASE BY SETTING THE            
                         IN-MEMORY DATA BASE ALLOCATION TO ZERO THROUGH THE NASTRAN MENU.                
                         USERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RECOMPILE "NASTRN.F" WITH A LARGER ALLOCATION           
                         FOR COMMON /ZZZZZZ/ IF THEIR PLATFORM SUPPORTS A LARGER MEMORY ALLOCATION.      
                         A LARGER ALLOCATION OF COMMON /ZZZZZZ/ PROVIDES FOR MORE SPACE FOR THE          
                         IN-MEMORY DATA BASE AND ALLOWS FOR MORE FILES TO BE MAINTAINED WITHIN
