                         AN IN-MEMORY DATA BASE IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL PLATFORMS.  THE IN-MEMORY           
                         DATA BASE ELIMINATES I/O TO DISK.  LOGIC EXISTS TO AUTOMATICALLY WRITE          
                         FILES TO DISK AFTER THE IN-MEMORY DATA BASE SPACE IS EXHAUSTED.  THE COMMON     
                         /ZZZZZZ/ IS USED FOR ALLOCATING OPEN CORE AND SPACE FOR THE IN-MEMORY           
                         DATA BASE.  THE SIZE OF COMMON /ZZZZZZ/ IS DEFINED IN ./MDS/NASTRN.F            
                         (SEE ARRAY "IZ" AND VARIABLE "LENOPC").   ALL REMAINING SPACE AFTER             
                         ALLOCATING OPEN CORE IS USED FOR THE IN-MEMORY DATA BASE.  THE USER             
                         CONTROLS THE ALLOCATION OF OPEN CORE THROUGH THE NASTRAN MENU.  THE             
                         USER CAN ELIMINATE THE USE OF THE IN-MEMORY DATA BASE BY SETTING THE            
                         IN-MEMORY DATA BASE ALLOCATION TO ZERO THROUGH THE NASTRAN MENU.                
                         USERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RECOMPILE "NASTRN.F" WITH A LARGER ALLOCATION           
                         FOR COMMON /ZZZZZZ/ IF THEIR PLATFORM SUPPORTS A LARGER MEMORY ALLOCATION.      
                         A LARGER ALLOCATION OF COMMON /ZZZZZZ/ PROVIDES FOR MORE SPACE FOR THE          
                         IN-MEMORY DATA BASE AND ALLOWS FOR MORE FILES TO BE MAINTAINED WITHIN           
                         THE IN-MEMORY DATA BASE.  USERS SHOULD ALWAYS ALLOCATE SUFFICIENT               
                         OPEN CORE TO PREVENT SPILL LOGIC (E.G., SEE USER INFORMATION MESSAGE

                         THERE IS NO SUCH PENALTY FOR OVER-ALLOCATING MEMORY FOR THE IN-MEMORY
