   METHOD 

           THERE ARE FIVE SECTIONS IN THIS FILE. EACH SECTION IS SEPARATED
           BY AN EQUAL LINE, SUCH AS '========='.

           SECTION ONE BEGINS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NASINFO FILE
               AND GOES TO THE FIRST EQUAL LINE.  THIS SECTION DESCRIBES
               THE CONTENTS OF THE NASINFO FILE.

           SECTION TWO CONTAINS SYSTEM PARAMETERS THAT ARE  
               INSTALLATION DEPENDENT.

           SECTION THREE CONTAINS BCD-LOOK-ALIKE WORDS WHICH ARE REALLY
               FLOATING POINT NUMBERS (MACHINE DEPENDENT).  THIS SECTION IS
               USED BY SUBROUTINE NUMTYP.

           SECTION FOUR CONTAINS LOCAL INSTALLATION MESSAGES. 

           SECTION FIVE IS RESERVED FOR DIAG 48 INFORMATION MESSAGES AND
               CONTAINS AN ITEMIZATION OF NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE.
           
   FORMATS OF SECTIONS

           THE FORMAT OF THE FIRST SECTION IS 80 COLUMN TEXT.

           THE FORMAT OF THE SECOND SECTION IS A 4 LETTER SYMBOL; FOLLOWED  
           BY AN "="; FOLLOWED BY A 7-DIGIT VALUE; AND AT THE END A COMMENT.
           A FORTRAN FORMAT FOR THIS IS (A4,'=',I7).  THE SYMBOL NAMES
           ARE UNIQUE AND CANNOT BE CHANGED.  THE ORDER OF THE SYMBOLS IS
           ARBITRARY.  A VALUE OF -99 INDICATES THAT THE PARAMETER IS NOT SET.
           ANY SYMBOL THAT IS NOT USED (I.E., VALUE = -99) CAN BE DELETED.  
           BLANK LINES ARE OPTIONAL.  THE SYMBOL 'TIM' REQUIRES TWO LINES 
           OF INPUT VALUES.

           THE FORMAT FOR THE THIRD SECTION CONSISTS OF TWO LINES PER
           ENTRY.  THE FIRST LINE HAS A FORTRAN FORMAT OF (I2,I4,2X,A20)
           AND SPECIFIES THE COMPUTER FOR WHICH THE DATA IN THE SECOND
           LINE IS TO APPLY.  THE FIRST FIELD IS THE ID NUMBER ASSIGNED
           TO THE COMPUTER (THIS NUMBER CANNOT BE CHANGED).  THE SECOND 
           FIELD DEFINES HOW MANY BCD-LOOK-ALIKE VALUES ARE GIVEN
           IN THE FOLLOWING LINE.  THE LAST FIELD GIVES TEXT THAT 
           DEFINES THE COMPUTER.  THE FORTRAN FORMAT OF THE SECOND LINE IS
           (5X,19(A4,1X)).  
                                                
           THE FORMAT OF SECTION FOUR IS 80 COLUMN TEXT.  ALL LINES INCLUDED
           WILL BE PRINTED IN LOCAL NASTRAN JOBS IF THE NASINFO
           FILE IS ASSIGNED.  A NEW PAGE IS INDICATED BY PUTTING '====    ' 
           IN COLUMNS 1 THRU 8.  IF NO TEXT IS GIVEN, THE LAST EQUAL-LINE 
           SHOULD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW THE PREVIOUS EQUAL-LINE, WITH NO 
           INTERVENING BLANK LINES.

           THE FORMAT OF SECTION FIVE IS 80 COLUMN TEXT.


DESIGN REQUIREMENTS 

           THIS FILE SHOULD BE READ-ONLY AND ASSIGNED TO NASTRAN.
           IF THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST, NASTRAN WILL NOT ABORT.
           THIS FILE IS PROCESSED ONLY BY SUBROUTINE NSINFO.  
           THE SUBROUTINE CALLING SEQUENCE IS AS FOLLOWS:
                NSINFO CALLED BY NASCAR
                NASCAR CALLED BY TTLPGE
                TTLPGE CALLED BY XCSA
                XCSA   CALLED BY SEMINT
                SEMINT CALLED BY ...


COMMENTS ABOUT GINO TIMING CONSTANTS (TIM) IN SECTION 2 FOLLOW:

           IF THE VALUE OF TIM IS NOT 16, THEN THIS LINE AND THE  
           NEXT 2 LINES ARE SKIPPED IN THE SECTION THAT FOLLOWS.
           IN EACH NASTRAN JOB, NASTRAN RUNS THROUGH A SERIES OF GINO TIMING
           COMPUTATIONS AND ESTABLISHES THE 16 GINO TIMING CONSTANTS. IF THESE
           CONSTANTS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO NASTRAN, THE TIMING COMPUTATIONS
           ARE SKIPPED, THUS SAVING CPU TIME IN ALL NASTRAN JOBS.

           THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO MAKE THESE CONSTANTS AVAILABLE TO NASTRAN -
           (1)  HARD CODE THE CONSTANTS TO NASTRAN VIA LABEL COMMON /NTIME/
                IN SUBROUTINE SEMDBD. (COMPILE AND RE-LINK LINK1).
           (2)  ENTER 'TIM = 16', AND IN THE NEXT 2 LINES, ENTER THE 16 
                TIMING CONSTANTS IN (12X,8F7.2) FORMAT.

           TO OBTAIN THESE 16 TIMING CONSTANTS, SUBMIT A SIMPLE NASTRAN RUN
           WITH A 'NASTRAN BULKDATA=-3' CARD.  THESE CONSTANTS MAY THEN BE
           EDITED INTO THIS NASINFO FILE.  TIME UNIT IS IN MICROSECONDS. 
           IF TIME IS LESS THAN 0.001 MICROSECOND, USE +0.001 
           (ZERO TIMES MAY GET NASTRAN INTO TROUBLE.)

NASTRAN RELEASE NEWS -





95 RELEASE
----------
NEW METHODS WERE INSTALLED FOR SYMMETRIC DECOMPOSITION, FORWARD/BACKWARD 
SUBSTITUTION (SYMMETRIC MATRICES ONLY), AND MATRIX MULTIPLY/ADD.  IN 
ADDITION, COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS WERE MADE TO THE FEER
EIGENVALUE ANALYSIS.  

THE FOLLOWING DIAGS WERE ADDED FOR THESE NEW CAPABILITIES:

        DIAG                       DESCRIPTION

        45              PROVIDE STATISTICS FOR NEW SYMMETRIC DECOMPOSITION 
                        METHOD
        47              PROVIDE STATISTICS FOR NEW FORWARD/BACKWARD
                        SUBSTITUTION METHOD

DIAG 19 STILL GIVES STATISTICAL INFORMATION FOR BOTH THE OLD AND THE NEW
MATRIX MULTIPLY/ADD METHODS.

IN ADDITION, THE "SYSTEM(58)=" PARAMETER ON THE "NASTRAN" CARD MAY BE
USED TO SPECIFY A PARTICULAR MATRIX MULTIPLY/ADD METHOD.  THE OLD METHODS
ARE 1, 2 AND 3 (TRANSPOSE ONLY).  THE NEW METHODS ARE 10, 11, 20, 21, 30,
31, 32, 40 AND 41.  A METHOD IS SELECTED BASED ON THE DENSITY OF THE
MATRIX AND HOW MANY PASSES ARE REQUIRED TO COMPUTE THE RESULTING MATRIX
UNLESS "SYSTEM(58)" IS USED.

THE DIFFERENCES IN THE METHODS ARE SEEN IN THE TABLE BELOW:

AN IN-MEMORY DATA BASE IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL PLATFORMS.  THE IN-MEMORY
DATA BASE ELIMINATES I/O TO DISK.  LOGIC EXISTS TO AUTOMATICALLY WRITE
FILES TO DISK AFTER THE IN-MEMORY DATA BASE SPACE IS EXHAUSTED.  THE COMMON
/ZZZZZZ/ IS USED FOR ALLOCATING OPEN CORE AND SPACE FOR THE IN-MEMORY
DATA BASE.  THE SIZE OF COMMON /ZZZZZZ/ IS DEFINED IN ./MDS/NASTRN.F
(SEE ARRAY "IZ" AND VARIABLE "LENOPC").   ALL REMAINING SPACE AFTER
ALLOCATING OPEN CORE IS USED FOR THE IN-MEMORY DATA BASE.  THE USER
CONTROLS THE ALLOCATION OF OPEN CORE THROUGH THE NASTRAN MENU.  THE
USER CAN ELIMINATE THE USE OF THE IN-MEMORY DATA BASE BY SETTING THE
IN-MEMORY DATA BASE ALLOCATION TO ZERO THROUGH THE NASTRAN MENU.
USERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RECOMPILE "NASTRN.F" WITH A LARGER ALLOCATION 
FOR COMMON /ZZZZZZ/ IF THEIR PLATFORM SUPPORTS A LARGER MEMORY ALLOCATION.  
A LARGER ALLOCATION OF COMMON /ZZZZZZ/ PROVIDES FOR MORE SPACE FOR THE
IN-MEMORY DATA BASE AND ALLOWS FOR MORE FILES TO BE MAINTAINED WITHIN
THE IN-MEMORY DATA BASE.  USERS SHOULD ALWAYS ALLOCATE SUFFICIENT 
OPEN CORE TO PREVENT SPILL LOGIC (E.G., SEE USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 
3023).  IT IS INEFFICIENT TO ALLOCATE TOO MUCH OPEN CORE.  HOWEVER, 
THERE IS NO SUCH PENALTY FOR OVER-ALLOCATING MEMORY FOR THE IN-MEMORY 
DATA BASE.

AT THE END OF THE LOG FILE, A SUMMARY OF ALL GINO I/O ACTIVITY IS GIVEN
SHOWING THE PERCENT OF USAGE OF THE IN-MEMORY DATA BASE AND THE AMOUNT
OF DISK I/O FOR THE NASTRAN EXECUTION.

THE USER'S MANUAL IS PROVIDED ON THE DELIVERABLE TAPE AS TEXT FILES.  THE
FILES ARE IN ASCII, 80 COLUMN FORMAT.  THE USER CAN EXAMINE THESE FILES WITH
A SYSTEM EDITOR, OR THROUGH THE USE OF THE NASTHELP PROGRAM, WHICH IS INCLUDED 
WITH THIS NASTRAN RELEASE.  THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS A USER TO SEARCH, READ AND/OR 
PRINT A PORTION OF THE FILE QUICKLY.  THE ENTIRE MANUAL IS STORED IN THE 
FOLLOWING FILES:

A UTILITY PROGRAM, "NASTHELP", IS PROVIDED TO ALLOW FOR EASY ACCESS TO
THE ABOVE TEXT FILES.  NASTHELP IS USER FRIENDLY AND REQUIRES NO 
WRITTEN INSTRUCTION, EXCEPT THAT THE NASTHELP EXECUTABLE AND 
THE .TXT FILES MUST BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY.
