      SUBROUTINE MPYAD (ZZ      ,Z      ,ZD      )
C
C     THE FOLLOWING DEFINES THE VARIOUS I/O METHODS AND STORAGE METHODS USED
C  BY THE DIFFERENT MULTIPLY-ADD METHODS.  
C
C  IN REGARDS TO THE NEW METHODS BELOW, WHEN MULTIPLE COLUMNS OF A MATRIX
C  ARE STORED AND READ BY GETSTR, THEN THE MATRIX IS STORED IN MEMORY IN 
C  COMPACT FORM.  SEE SUBROUTINES 'MMARM1,2,3,4' FOR A DESCRIPTION OF 
C  THIS COMPACT FORM.  WHEN ONLY A SINGLE COLUMN OF A MATRIX IS STORED 
C  AND IT IS BEING READ BY GETSTR, IT IS STORED IN COMPACT FORM IN MEMORY.  
C  SEE SUBROUTINES 'MMARC1,2,3,4' FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THIS FORM.
