      FUNCTION KRSHFT (IWORD,N)
C
C     CHARACTER FUNCTION KRSHFT AND KLSHFT PERFORM LEFT AND RIGHT
C     SHIFTS, BY N CHARACTERS (BYTES).
C     EMPTY BYTES ARE ZERO FILLED.
C
C     NORMALLY, KRSHFT AND KLSHFT WORK ALMOST LIKE RSHIFT AND LSHFIT
C     RESPECTIVELY, EXCEPT THEY MOVE DATA BY BYTE COUNT, NOT BY BITS.
C     HOWEVER, IF THE MACHINE STORES THE BCD WORD DATA IN REVERSE ORDER
C     (SUCH AS VAX AND SILICON GRAPHICS), KRSHFT IS EQUIVALENCED TO
C     LSHFIT, AND KLSFHT TO RSHIFT.
