      SUBROUTINE ROMBSK (B,PRECIS,ITDONE,FINTG,K,X)
C
C     THIS SUBROUTINE IS USED TO INTEGRATE A FUNCTION FROM X=0. TO X=B
C
C     SINGLE PRECISION VERSION
C
C     B      = UPPER LIMIT
C     NOSIG  = NUMBER OF CORRECT SIGNIFICANT DIGITS DESIRED
C              (NOT MORE THAN 7) = 5
C     PRECIS = 0.0  UPON RETURN, PRECIS = ACTUAL NUMBER
C              OF SIGNIFICANT DIGITS ATTAINED
C     NUM    = MAXIMUM NUMBER OF HALVINGS OF B-A TO BE MADE
C              (NOT MORE THAN 99) = 15
C
C     UPON RETURN FROM ROMBSK, THE VALUE OF THE INTEGRAL WILL BE FOUND
C     IN FINTG.
C
C     IT IS CUSTOMARY TO MEASURE THE PRECISION OF LARGE NUMBERS IN
C     TERMS OF NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT DIGITS AND THE ACCURACY OF SMALL
C     NUMBERS IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT DECIMALS.  TO CONFORM
C     TO THIS PRACTICE, THE SUBROUTINE TERMINATES WHEN EITHER OF THESE
C     CONDITIONS IS MET.
