6.1  NASTRAN MESSAGES

   There are three categories of diagnostic messages in NASTRAN. They are:

   1. Rigid format error messages

   2. Structure plotter error messages

   3. NASTRAN system and user diagnostic messages

   The rigid format error messages are fully described in Volume II under the
description of the individual rigid formats. The structure plotter error
messages are described in Section 4.2.3. The NASTRAN system and user
diagnostic messages are detailed in this section.

   The system and user diagnostic messages issued by NASTRAN are identified by
numbers. Message numbers have been assigned in groups as follows:

      1  - 1000   Preface Messages

   1001  - 2000   Executive Module Messages

   2001  -        Functional Module Messages

These messages have the following format:

        É        »  É             »
        º SYSTEM º  º FATAL       º
   ***  º        º  º WARNING     º MESSAGE id, text
        º USER   º  º INFORMATION º
        È        ¼  È             ¼

where "id" is a unique message identification number and "text" is the message
as indicated in capital letters for each of the diagnostic messages. A series
of asterisks in the text indicates information that will be filled in for a
specific use of the message, such as the number of a grid point or the name of
a bulk data card. Many of the messages are followed by additional explanatory
material, including suggestions for remedial action.

   The system and user messages described in this section pertain only to
those messages generated by NASTRAN. Although these messages can appear at
various places in the output stream, they should be easily identified by their
format. The various computer operating systems also produce diagnostic
messages that can appear at various places in the output stream. The format of
these messages will vary with the operating system. Reference should be made
to the operating system manuals for interpretation of the messages that are
not generated by NASTRAN.

   System messages refer to diagnostics that are associated with program
errors. In general, you cannot correct such. Refer to the Programmer's Manual
and assistance secured from the programming staff. User messages refer to
errors that are usually associated with the preparation of the NASTRAN Data
Deck. Corrective action is indicated in the message text or the explanatory
information following the text. In some cases reference may have to be made to
other sections of the User's Manual for proper card formats or for
clarification of procedures.

   Fatal messages cause the termination of the execution following the
printing of the message text. These messages will always appear at the end of
the NASTRAN output. Warning and information messages will appear at various
places in the output stream. Such messages only convey warnings or
information. Consequently, the execution continues in a normal manner
following the printing of the message text.

   As an example, consider message number 2025, which will appear in the
printed output as follows:

   *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 2025, UNDEFINED COORDINATE SYSTEM 102.

The three leading asterisks (***) are always present in the system and user
diagnostic messages. The word USER indicates that this is a user message
rather than a system message. The word FATAL indicates that this is a fatal
message rather than a warning or an information message. The number 2025 is
the identification number for this message. The text of the message follows
the comma (,). The number 102 replaces the asterisks (****) in the general
message text, and indicates that 102 is the identification number of the
undefined coordinate system.

         PROCESSING INFORMATION.

        DIAG 38 gives a list of elements being processed. If the EMG module
        stops due to element error, and DIAG 38 is on, the last element on
        the list is the one that erred.

248 ***  USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 248, TURN DIAG 48 ON FOR NASTRAN RELEASE NEWS,
         DIAG DEFINITION, NEW DMAP MODULES, AND NEW BULKDATA CARDS INFORMATION.

        larger than THRU pair terminates THRU. Either list exceptions
        explicitly, use two THRUs, or terminate first THRU.

617 ***  USER FATAL MESSAGE 617, INCORRECT OR MISSING VALUE ON CASE CONTROL
         CARD. CHECK FOR CORRECT CARD FORMAT.

        Most integer values in Case Control must be positive. The above card

1141  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 1141, FIRST WORD OF A DOUBLE PRECISION STRING IS
           NOT ON A DOUBLE PRECISION BOUNDARY.

          This error is probably due to a bug in any of PUTSTR, OPEN, or
          NASTIO, all of which have responsibility for ensuring proper
          alignment.

1142  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 1142, CURRENT BUFFER POINTER IS BEYOND RANGE OF
           INFORMATION IN BUFFER.

           NOT WRITTEN WITH STRING TRAILERS.

1147  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 1147, STRING RECOGNITION WORD NOT RECOGNIZED.

          A subroutine may not have called GETSTR to indicate completion of
          processing of previous string or a bug in GETSTR logic.

1148  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 1148, RECORD CONTROL WORD NOT IN EXPECTED
           POSITION.

          Logic error in GETSTR or PUTSTR when string was written.

          undefined. Possible causes include, but are not limited to, (1) the
          length of a rod or bar is zero because the end points have the same
          coordinates, (2) the sides of a triangle or quadrilateral are
          collinear which leads to a zero cross product in defining an
          element coordinate system, or (3) the bar orientation vector is

3016  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3016, **** MATRIX IS NOT IN PROPER FORM IN
           SUBROUTINE ****.

          The input matrix is not in the proper form or type acceptable to
          the subroutine. Check the trailer information on the matrix and the
          subroutine description for the discrepancy.

3017  ***  USER WARNING MESSAGE 3017, ONE OR MORE GRID POINT SINGULARITIES HAVE
           NOT BEEN REMOVED BY SINGLE OR MULTI-POINT CONSTRAINTS.

          Singularities or near singularities may exist at the grid point
          level. The listed singularities should be examined for data errors.
          The check performed here is neither necessary nor sufficient for a
          singular matrix.

3018  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3018, MODULE ********, SEQUENCE NO. ***,
           REQUIREMENTS EXCEED AVAILABLE FILES.

          Segment File Allocator (SFA) did not have sufficient logical files
          available to fulfill the request of the module. Cut module
          requirements or increase the logical files within the computer
          system. See Section 5 of the Programmer's Manual.

3019  ***  USER FATAL MESSAGE 3019, MAXIMUM LINE COUNT EXCEEDED IN SUBROUTINE
           **** LINE COUNT EQUALS ****.

          The total number of lines written on the system output file has
          exceeded the set limit (default value is 20,000). If you wish to
          increase this value, include a card of the form "MAXLINES=n" in
          your Case Control Deck.

3020  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3020, GNFIST OVERFLOWED FIST TABLE AT SEQUENCE
           NO. *** DATA SET ********.

          compiled size. See Section 2 of the Programmer's Manual.

3021  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3021, FILE *** NOT DEFINED IN FIST.

          An operation other than OPEN or CLOSE is requested on a file which
          is not defined in the FIST.

3022  ***  SYSTEM WARNING MESSAGE 3022, DATA SET ******** IS REQUIRED AS INPUT
           AND IS NOT OUTPUT BY A PREVIOUS MODULE IN THE CURRENT DMAP ROUTE.

          Segment File Allocator (SFA) detected that an input data block to a
          future module has not been generated. If the future module requires
          that this data block exist, the module may terminate with a fatal
          error.

          This message may occur (and most often does) when the Segment File
          Allocator has removed from its tables (due to a need for more room)
          previously purged data blocks. In this case no error or even a
          warning is implied.

           SPILL GROUPS = ****** C MAX ******             PREFACE LOOPS = ******

          N is the number of rows in the data block; TIME is the estimate (in
          seconds) to perform the decomposition; C AVG is the average number
          of active columns per pivot row; PC AVG is the average number of
          passive columns at each active termination point; SPILL GROUPS is
          the number of spill groups; S AVG is the average number of rows in
          each spill group; ADDITIONAL CORE (positive) is the amount of core
          required to avoid spill, (negative) is the amount of unused core; C
          MAX is the maximum number of active columns in any one pivot row;
          PC MAX is the maximum number of passive columns at any one active
          column termination point; PC GROUPS is the number of active column
          termination points; PREFACE LOOPS is the number of times the
          preface of the decomposition subroutine is executed.

3024  ***  USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 3024, THE BANDWIDTH OF MATRIX **** EXCEEDS
           THE MAXIMUM BANDWIDTH. A MAXIMUM BANDWIDTH OF **** WILL BE USED.

          This message indicates that a matrix has scattered terms way off
          the diagonal (that is, a large bandwidth). Instead of searching all
          combinations of B and C, the search is started at the maximum
          bandwidth.

3025  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3025, ILLEGAL INDEX IN ACTIVE ROW OR COLUMN
           CALCULATION IN ****.

          Possible machine error. Rerun problem. If error persists, a code
          error exists in the decomposition routine.

3026  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3026, MATRIX **** EXCEEDS MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE SIZE
           FOR BANDWIDTH PLUS ACTIVE COLUMNS. BMAX = ****, CMAX = ****.

          Sufficient space was not reserved for the generation of the B vs. C
          vector. SDCOMP should be recompiled to increase BMAX and CMAX.

3027  ***  USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 3027, **** DECOMPOSITION OF DATA BLOCK ****
           (N = ****) TIME ESTIMATE IS ******** SECONDS.

          Gives the estimated time required for a decomposition in seconds
          and the type of matrix, that is, complex, real (double or single
          precision), symmetric, or unsymmetric.

3028  ***  USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 3028, B = ****, BBAR = ****, C =  ****, CBAR
           = ***, R = ****.

          Gives the upper bandwidth (B), lower bandwidth (BBAR), number of
          active columns (C), and active rows (CBAR) used in the unsymmetric
          decomposition.

3029  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3029, PHYSICAL END-OF-FILE ENCOUNTERED ON DATA
           SET **** (FILE ****).

          Since logical end-of-files are used by GINO, a physical end-of-file
          indicates an attempt to read beyond valid data.

3030  ***  USER WARNING MESSAGE 3030, OFP UNABLE TO PROCESS DATA BLOCK. A TABLE

          A particular set used in the problem was not included in the data.
          Good examples are loads, initial conditions, or frequency sets.
          Include the required data or change the Case Control Deck to select
          data already in problem. Set zero (0) has a special meaning. A set
          selection was required, but none was made. For example, no METHOD
          was selected for an eigenvalue extraction problem.

          This message can also indicate that a LOAD card has referenced
          another LOAD card, which is not permitted.

3033  ***  USER FATAL MESSAGE 3033, SUBCASE ID **** IS REFERENCED ON ONE OR MORE
           RANDPS CARDS BUT IS NOT A CURRENT SUBCASE ID.

          The RANDPS set selected can only reference subcase identification
          numbers included in the current loop. All subcases in which the
          direct input matrices or transfer functions do not change are run
          together. Either add a subcase with referenced identification
          number, change your RANDPS cards, or change the identification
          numbers on your current subcases.

          The off-diagonal terms of the modal mass matrix are larger than the
          user input criteria on the EIGB or EIGR bulk data card. The
          eigenvectors are not orthogonal to this extent. This non-
          orthogonality is especially important if a modal formulation is
          contemplated.

3035  ***  USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 3035, FOR LOAD ** EPSILON SUB E=*****.

           HAS NOT BEEN GENERATED OR PURGED.

          The above mentioned data set is not accounted for on the OPTP
          checkpoint dictionary. The message indicates a failure of the File
          Name Restart Table. As an interim measure, you can use the ALTER
          feature to execute the proper module to create the needed data set.

3037  ***  SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE 3037, JOB TERMINATED IN SUBROUTINE ****.

          This message designates the subroutine in which the program
          terminated. It should be preceded by a user message which explains
          the cause of the termination. The module in which the program
