4.1  PLOTTING IN NASTRAN

   NASTRAN provides the capability for generating the following kinds of
plots: 

   1. Undeformed geometric projections of the structural model.

   2. Static deformations of the structural model by either displaying the
      deformed shape (alone or superimposed on the undeformed shape), or
      displaying the displacement vectors at the grid points (superimposed on
      either the deformed or undeformed shape). 

   3. Modal deformations (sometimes called mode shapes or eigenvectors)
      resulting from real eigenvalue analysis by the same options stated in 2
      above. Complex modes of flutter analysis may be plotted for any user
      chosen phase lag. 

   4. Deformations of the structural model for transient response or frequency
      response by displaying either vectors or the deformed shape for
      specified times or frequencies. 

   5. X-Y graphs of responses (displacements, velocities, accelerations,
      element forces and element stresses) versus time (transient response),
      versus frequency (frequency response) or versus subcase (static
      analysis). 

   6. Y-f and Y-g graphs of flutter analysis.

   7. Topological displays of matrices.

   8. Contour plots of stresses and displacements (in a limited fashion). To
      avoid crowded output, an outline of the model may be optionally
      requested. 

   Structure plots (items 1-4 and 8) are discussed in Section 4.2. X-Y plots
(items 5 and 6) are discussed in Section 4.3. Matrix plots (item 7) are
generated by Utility Module SEEMAT, described in Section 5.5, and must be
accomplished by ALTERing this module into a rigid format DMAP sequence or by
using the DMAP approach. Requests for structure plots or X-Y plots are
accomplished in the Case Control Deck by submitting a structure plot request
packet or an X-Y output request packet. The discussion of these packets
constitutes most of the remainder of this section. The optional PLOTID card is
considered to be a part of the plot packets, although it must precede any
OUTPUT(PLOT), OUTPUT(XYOUT), or OUTPUT(XYPLOT) cards (see the PLOTID card in
Section 2.3). 

   In order to create plots, you must set up a physical plot tape or mass
storage area. There are two plot files, PLT1 and PLT2. It is only necessary to
specify file PLT2. File PLT1 is reserved for future use. The system control
cards needed to specify the PLT2 plot file are generally installation
dependent and are described in Section 5 of the Programmer's Manual. 

   The NASTRAN plotting software is completely independent of any particular
plotting hardware. This protects the NASTRAN software from being impacted by
changes, additions, or deletions made to plotting hardware. Instead, the plot
file produced by NASTRAN (the actual NASTRAN plot output may reside either on
physical tape or on a mass storage device) is meant for a hypothetical plotter
termed the NASTRAN General Purpose Plotter (NASTPLT) and is not suitable for
use directly by any particular plotter. In order to use this NASTPLT file to
obtain plots on any particular plotter, your installation must have available
an external translator program to interpret this plot file and create plots on
the plotter. A detailed description of the NASTPLT file is given in Section
4.4. The interested reader may also refer to Section 6.10 of the Programmer's
Manual, dealing with the plotting software in NASTRAN. 

   The type or model of the plotting hardware on which you will create your
plots is indicated to the NASTRAN plotting software on the PLOTTER card in
both structure plotting and X-Y plotting (see descriptions in Sections 4.2.2.4
and 4.3.2.5, respectively). You may specify either a microfilm, table, or drum
plotter. For each of these plotter types, you may also indicate whether the
plotter has typing capability or not. In the latter case, all characters will
be drawn. The default is a microfilm plotter without typing capability. 

   The operation of the Structure Plotter is of sufficient theoretical content
to warrant inclusion in the Theoretical Manual. Section 13 of the Theoretical
Manual provides a discussion of the basic theory and gives some examples of
plotter output. 

   The availability of NASTRAN plotting capability is a function of the
particular rigid format as shown in Table 4.1-1. 

4.1.1  Plot Frame Size and Character Size

   The frame size of the NASTPLT plots produced by NASTRAN depends upon the
model specified on the PLOTTER card. The default plot frame sizes for all the
three plotter models are given in the following table. 

                Default Plot Frame Size for the NASTPLT Plotters

        Plotter Model           Default Width             Default Height
                                  (inches)                   (inches)

          Microfilm                10.23                      10.23

          Table                    11.00                       8.50

          Drum                     30.00                      30.00

   The plot frame size for microfilm plotters is set at the above default size
and is not under user control. The frame size for the table and drum plotters
can be specified by you within limits, by means of the PAPER SIZE card in
structure plotting (see Section 4.2.2.4) and the XPAPER and YPAPER cards in
X-Y plotting (see Section 4.3.2.5). 

   As mentioned earlier, the NASTRAN plotting software will draw characters
when you have indicated that the plotter has no typing capability. By default,
each character produced by the NASTPLT plots is assigned a space of 0.08"
width by 0.16" height and within this space the character is derived from a
0.06" square. The size of the characters cannot be reduced below the default
size by you in the NASTRAN environment. However, you can magnify the
characters by the use of the CSCALE card in both structure plotting and X-Y
plotting (see description in Sections 4.2.2.4 and 4.3.2.5). Note, however,
that the integer factor used on the CSCALE card implies that the characters
can be magnified only in discrete steps. Also note that this factor is used to
multiply both the width and the height of the NASTPLT characters. Thus, a
character produced with a CSCALE value of 2 will take up an area that is four
times the area taken up by the default size character. 

   If you want to control the size of the characters relative to the plot, you
can do so by controlling the plot frame size for a given character size. Thus,
for a given CSCALE value, the size of the characters relative to the plot can
be increased by decreasing the plot frame size and decreased by increasing the
plot frame size. 

   If you want to scale up or down the size of both the plots and the
characters produced by NASTRAN, you can do so by means of the translator
program employed to create the plots. However, in this case, the size is
controlled outside the NASTRAN environment.

4.2  STRUCTURE PLOTTING

     In order to assist you both in the preparation of the analytical model and
in the interpretation of output, the structure plotter provides the following
capabilities for undeformed structures: 

     1.   Place a symbol at the grid point locations (optional).

     2.   Identify grid points by placing the grid point identification number 
          to the right of the grid point locations (optional). 

     3.   Identify elements by placing the element identification number and
          element label at the center of each element (optional).

     4.   Identify element properties by placing the element property 
          identification number near the element identification number and 
          element symbol (optional). 

     5.   Connect the grid points in an optional manner using structural 
          elements or PLOTEL elements. 

     6.   Reflect the symmetric portion of the structural elements about a
          designated axis (optional).

The following capabilities are provided for deformed structures:

     1.   Place a symbol at the deflected grid point location (optional).

     2.   Identify the deflected grid points by placing the grid point 
          identification number to the right of the deflected grid point 
          locations (optional). 

     3.   Identify elements by placing the element identification number and
          element label at the center of each element (optional).

     4.   Identify element properties by placing the element property 
          identification number near the element identification number and 
          element symbol (optional). 

     5.   Connect the deflected grid points in an optional manner using 
          structural elements or PLOTEL elements. 

     6.   Draw lines originating at the undeflected or deflected grid point 
          location, drawn to user-specified scale, representing the X, Y, Z 
          components or resultant summations of any of the grid point 
          deflection, velocity, or acceleration vectors. 

     7.   Draw different portions of the structure in different parts of a 
          frame, with different scales, labels, and symbols. 

     8.   Reflect the symmetric portion of the structural elements (which are 
          symmetrically or antisymmetrically loaded) about a designated axis 
          (optional). 

     9.   Superimpose the deflected shape over the undeflected shape (optional). 

     10.  Draw the outline of the structural elements which lie on the
          boundaries (optional).

     11.  Map the deflection or stress contours of two dimensional elements in
          a limited fashion (optional).

A request for structure plotting is made in the Case Control Deck by means of
a plot request packet which includes all cards from an OUTPUT(PLOT) card to
either a BEGIN BULK or OUTPUT(XYOUT) [or OUTPUT(XYPLOT)] card. It should be
noted that only elements can be plotted. (See the description of the SET card
in Section 4.2.2.4.) Grid points that are not associated with elements cannot
be plotted. Grid points may be connected with PLOTEL elements for plotting
purposes.

4.2.1  Structure Plotter Projections and Coordinate System

     Structure plots can be obtained in any one of three projections, namely,
orthographic, perspective, or stereoscopic projections. (Stereoscopic plots
are normally made only on microfilm plotters since a stereoscopic viewer or
projector must be used to obtain the stereoscopic effect.) These projections
as they relate to structure plotting and the plotter coordinate system
employed are described in the following sections. A theoretical treatment of
the projections is given in Section 13 of the Theoretical Manual.

4.2.1.1  Orthographic Projection

     The structural model is assumed to be defined in the basic coordinate
system, denoted as the X, Y, Z coordinate system. The plotter (or observer's)
coordinate system is defined as the R, S, T coordinate system. The direction
of view is in the negative R-direction and the projection plane is always in,
or parallel to, the S-T plane (see Figure 4.2-1).

     The origins of the X, Y, Z and R, S, T coordinate systems are taken to be
coincidental. The alignment of the X, Y, Z coordinate system with respect to
the R, S, T coordinate system is prescribed by the AXES card (see
description). The default alignment is for the X, Y, and Z axes to align with
the R, S and T axes, respectively. The orientation of the X, Y, Z coordinate
system with respect to the R, S, T coordinate system is defined by the three
angles à, á, and ç. These angles are prescribed by the VIEW card (see
description). (As can be seen, for the default alignment, the two coordinate
systems are coincident for à = á = ç = 0.)

     The order in which the rotations à, á, and ç are specified is critically
important to determine the final orientation of the X, Y, Z system with
respect to the R, S, T system. This order or sequence has been arbitrarily
chosen as ç, the rotation about the T-axis, followed by á, the rotation about
the S-axis, followed by à, the rotation about the R-axis. Normally, à is not
used since it does not affect the appearance of the S-T projection, but only
its orientation on the S-T plane.

=PAGE=
4.2.1.2  Perspective Projection

     In addition to the three angular relationships (à, á, ç) required for the
orthographic projection, the perspective projection requires knowledge of the
vantage point in the R, S, T system (that is, the three coordinates of the
observer) and the location of the projection plane (plotter surface). The
vantage point (coordinates Ro, So, To) is either selected by you or
automatically by the program and is taken to lie in the positive R-half space.
The projection plane is chosen to lie between the observer and the S-T plane.
This is illustrated in Figure 4.2-3.

4.2.1.3  Stereoscopic Projection

     The stereoscopic effect is obtained through the differences in images
received by the left and right eyes. Each is a perspective image, but with a
different vantage point. The two vantage points are separated by a distance
termed the ocular separation. You may supply this value, but the use of the
default value of 70 mm (2.756 inches) is recommended since it is the nominal
ocular separation standard used in commercially available stereoscopic cameras
and viewers. When using this projection, the program produces two plots for
viewing with a stereoscopic viewer.

4.2.2  Structure Plot Request Packet Data

4.2.2.1  Summary of Data Cards

     The only structure plot data cards that are always required are the SET and
PLOT cards. The FIND card is recommended for general use. All other cards are
related to the definition of various parameters and are strictly optional.

     The parameter cards specify how the structure will be plotted, that is,
type of projection, view angles, scales, etc. All the multiple choice
parameters are defaulted to a preselected choice if not specified. If a
parameter is defined more than once, the value or choice last stated (or
computed) will be used. Each parameter requiring a numerical value that is not
specified by you can either be established internally in the program by means
of the FIND card or can assume default values. The FIND card requests that the
program select a SCALE, ORIGIN, and/or VANTAGE POINT based on user-specified
parameters so as to allow the construction of a plot in a user-specified
region of the paper or film. All the parameters used in the generation of the
various plots will be printed out as part of the output, whether they are
directly specified, defaulted, or established using the FIND card.

     Initialization of parameters to default values occurs only once. These
values remain until altered by a direct input. The only exceptions are the
view angles, scale factors, vantage point parameters, and origins. Whenever
the plotter or the method of projection is changed, the view angles are reset
to the default values, unless they are re-specified by you. In addition, the
scale factors, vantage point parameters, and origin must be redefined by you.

     The structure plot data cards are generally sequence independent, but it is
important to note that the dependencies on which a FIND card or a PLOT card is
based must precede these cards. Thus, for example, a SET card defining the
elements and grid points to be plotted may be defined anywhere in the
submittal, but it must appear prior to a FIND card or a PLOT card that
references that SET. Also, if a PLOTTER card is used, it is recommended that
it be the very first card in the structure plot request data after the
OUTPUT(PLOT) card in the Case Control Deck.

     A summary of the data cards is given in Table 4.2-1.

4.2.2.2  Plot Titles

     Up to four lines of title information will be printed in the lower
left-hand corner of each plot. The text for the top three lines is taken from
the TITLE, SUBTITLE, and LABEL cards in the Case Control Deck. (See Sections
2.3.2 and 2.3.4 for a description of the TITLE, SUBTITLE, and LABEL cards.)
The text for the bottom line may be of two forms depending on the type of plot
requested. One form contains the word UNDEFORMED SHAPE. The other form
contains the type of plot (statics, nodal, etc), subcase number, load set or
mode number, frequency or eigenvalue or time, and (for complex quantities)
phase lag or magnitude. This information is taken from the PLOT card in the
plot request packet.

     Each plot frame, or group of frames, resulting from a single PLOT command
may also have a line of information to the right of the SUBTITLE text. This is
taken from the PTITLE card in the plot request packet.

     The sequence number for each plot is printed in the upper corners of each
frame. The sequence number is determined by the relative position of each PLOT
execution card in the plot package. The date and (for deformed plots) the
maximum deformation are also printed at the top of each frame.

4.2.2.3  Data Card Specification Rules and Format

     The format of the structure plot data cards is free-field. The following
rules apply to their specification:

     1.   Only data in columns 1 through 72 is processed. Any information
          specified in columns 73 through 80 is ignored.

     2.   If the last character on a card is a comma (not necessarily in 
          column 72), the next card is a continuation of this physical card. 
          Any number of continuation cards may be specified, and together they 
          form a logical card. 

     3.   The mnemonics or values can be placed anywhere on the card, but must 
          be separated by delimiters. 

     4.   The following delimiters are used:

          a.            blank

          b. ,          comma

          c. (          left parenthesis

          d. )          right parenthesis

          e. =     equal sign

          All of these delimiters can be used as needed to aid the legibility of
          the data.

     In the data card descriptions presented in Section 4.2.2.4, the following
notations are used to describe the card format:

     1. Upper-case letters and parentheses must be punched as shown.

     2. Lower-case letters indicate that a substitution must be made.

                        É »
     3. Double brackets º º indicate that a choice of contents is mandatory.
                        È ¼

                 Ú ¿
     4. Brackets ³ ³ contain an option that may be omitted or included by the
        user.    À Ù

     5. First listed options or values are the default values.

     6. Physical card consists of information punched in columns 1 through 72 
        of a card. 

     7. Logical card may have more than 72 columns with the use of continuation
        cards.

4.2.2.4  Data Card Descriptions

     All of the structure plot data cards are discussed on the following pages.
The descriptions are arranged in alphabetical order by card names. The general
form for each card is shown. The description of the card contents follows. An
example of each card usage is given immediately below the general form except
for the PLOT and SET cards, where the examples follow the descriptions of the
cards.

AXES - XYZ Axes Alignment Specification

Description

Defines the alignment of the XYZ axes (the basic coordinate system of the
object) in terms of the RST axes (the observer's coordinate system). See
Figure 4.2-1.

Format and Example

       É   »     É   »     É   »    Ú É               » ¿

AXES    MX, Y, MZ

Option             Meaning

r                  The axis that is aligned with the R-axis (BCD). See Remark 2.

s                  The axis that is aligned with the S-axis (BCD). See Remark 2.

t                  The axis that is aligned with the T-axis (BCD). See Remark 2.

SYMMETRIC          Obtain an undeformed or deformed plot of the symmetric 
                   portion of an object. See Remarks 3 and 4. 

ANTISYMMETRIC      Plot the deformations antisymmetrically with respect to the 
                   specified plane or planes. See Remarks 3 and 4.

Remarks

1.   This card is optional.

2.   Each of the options r, s, and t may have any one of the six BCD values X,
     Y, Z, MX, MY, or MZ ("M" denotes the negative directions of the axes) so
     that together they represent three mutually perpendicular axes, defining a
     right-handed coordinate system.

3.   By properly selecting the options r, s, and t on the AXES card, any desired
     orientation can be obtained by the VIEW card (see description) by
     specifying rotations that are all less than 90.0 degrees.

4.   The SYMMETRIC option by itself does not in any way affect the plot output.
     It can be specified to indicate (for informational purposes only) that the
     alignment defined by the AXES card represents the symmetric reflection of
     the structure, but the actual plot of the symmetric portion can be obtained
     only by suitably specifying the alignment of the XYZ axes on the AXES card.
     See Remark 6.

5.   The ANTISYMMETRIC option causes the signs of the deformations to be
     reversed before they are plotted. If you want this antisymmetrically
     deformed plot to appear in the reflected position with respect to one or
     more planes of symmetry, you should appropriately specify the alignment of
     the XYZ axes on the AXES card. See Remark 7.

6.   An undeformed or deformed plot of the symmetric portion of an object can be
     obtained by reversing the sign of the axis that is normal to the plane of
     symmetry. In the case of multiple planes of symmetry, the signs of all
     associated planes should be reversed.

7.   The ANTISYMMETRIC option is useful when a symmetric structure is loaded in
     an unsymmetric manner. In this case, you can specify the ANTISYMMETRIC
     option and also suitably define the alignment of the XYZ axes on the AXES
     card so as to cause the deformations to be plotted antisymmetrically with
     respect to one or more planes of symmetry.

8.   Since the AXES card applies to all parts (SETs) of a single frame,
     symmetric and antisymmetric combinations cannot be made with this card. The
     SYMMETRY and ANTISYMMETRY options on the PLOT card (see description) can be
     employed for that purpose.

te                 Fractional distance of top edge of plot region from the 
                   lower left corner of the image area (Real). 

Remarks

1.   This card is optional, but is recommended for general use.

2.   Multiple FIND cards are permitted for use with different plots. Each FIND
     card must be one logical card.

3.   This card computes any of the indicated parameters SCALE, ORIGIN i, and
     VANTAGE POINT based on:

     -    The plotter requested on the PLOTTER card.

     -    The type of projection requested on the PROJECTION card.

     -    SET j and REGION le, be, re, te requested on the FIND card.

     -    The orientation requested on the AXES and/or VIEW card(s).

     -    The deformation scaling requested on the MAXIMUM DEFORMATION card.

     -    The paper size requested on the PAPER SIZE card (for table and drum
          plotters).

     The dependencies on which a FIND card is based must precede the FIND card.

4.   Any one, two, or all three of the parameters may be computed by the program
     by using this card, provided that the parameters not requested have already
     been defined. If no SET is specified on this card, the first SET defined is
     used by default. If no options are specified, a SCALE and VANTAGE POINT are
     selected and ORIGIN 1 is located, using the first defined SET, so that the
     plotted object is located within the image area. The plot region is defined
     as some fraction of the image area (image area = 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0. and
     first quadrant = 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0). The image area is located inside the
     margins on the paper.

5.   If a parameter is defined more than once, the value or choice last stated
     (or computed) will be used. Because of this, it is recommended that the
     FIND card be inserted immediately before the PLOT command to which its
     values apply to ensure that previous values of the parameters are
     overridden.

6.   The scale used in plotting (see the description of the SCALE card for the
     definition) is f x s, where f is the value specified on the FIND card (a
     default value of 1.0 is used if f is not specified) and s is the scale
     factor initially computed at the instance of the FIND card.

MAXIMUM DEFORMATION - Maximum Displacement Specification

Description

Specifies the scale of the maximum displacement component in units of the
structure.

Format and Example

MAXIMUM DEFORMATION  dmax

MAXIMUM DEFORMATION   5.0

Option             Meaning

dmax               Length to which the maximum displacement component is 
                   scaled in each subcase (Real). The value should be 
                   specified in units of the structure, not inches of paper. 
                   See Remark 3. 

Remarks

1.   This card is optional and is applicable only to plots of deformed
     structures. It's use is recommended in such cases. This is because the
     actual deformations are usually too small to be distinguishable from the
     undeformed structure if they are plotted to true scale. If this card is not
     used, a default value of 5% of the maximum (that is, 0.05 max (Smax - Smin,
     Tmax - Tmin)) is assumed for dmax.

2.   If the FIND card parameters are to be based on the deformed structure, the
     FIND card must be preceded by the MAXIMUM DEFORMATION card.

3.   If the MAXIMUM DEFORMATION parameter d on the PLOT card (see description)
     is not specified, the maximum displacement component in each subcase will
     be scaled to a value equal to dmax specified on the MAXIMUM DEFORMATION
     card. But if the MAXIMUM DEFORMATION parameter d on the PLOT card is
     specified, the maximum displacement component for all subcases will be
     scaled to a value equal to dmax/d. Thus, in the latter case, each subcase
     will have a different maximum displacement component.

os                 S-direction separation (in inches) of the two vantage 
                   points used in stereoscopic projection (Real). (See the 
                   discussion in Section 4.2.1.3). 

Remarks

1.   This card is optional. It is applicable only for stereoscopic projection.

2.   It is recommended that the default value of 2.756 inches be used. This is
     the separation used in standard stereoscopic cameras and viewers (70 mm).

u                  Displacement, parallel to the S-axis, of the paper origin 
                   from the RST origin (for stereoscopic projection, 
                   displacement, parallel to the S-axis, of the paper origin 
                   for the left eye from the RST origin) (Real). 

v                  Displacement, parallel to the T-axis, of the paper origin 
                   from the RST origin (Real).

                   for the right eye from the RST origin (stereoscopic 
                   projection only) (Real). 

Remarks

1.   This card is optional, but is not recommended for general use. See the
     description of the FIND card in order to have the origin located
     automatically so as to place the plotted object in the center of the image
     area.

2.   The displacements specified are in inches and are not subject to the
     scaling of the plotted object.

3.   In the transformations performed for any of the three projections, the
     origins of the object (XYZ) and the observer (RST) are assumed to be
     coincident.

4.   Ten (10) origins are permitted to be active at any one time. However, any
     one can be redefined at any time. An eleventh origin is also provided if
     more than 10 origins are erroneously defined (that is, only the last of
     these surplus origins will be retained). CAUTION: When a new projection or
     plotter is called for, all previously defined origins are deleted.

Remarks

1.   This card is optional. It is applicable only for table and drum plotters.

2.   Pen designations vary on different plotters and the actual number of pens
     available will depend on the plotter hardware configuration at an
     installation. Therefore, the designation numbers used here should be
     regarded only as pointers to the true identification of the pens.

3.   This card generates a message on the printed output which may be used for
     the purpose of informing the plotter operator as to what size and which
     color pen point to mount in the various pen holders.

4.   This card does not control the pen used in generating the plot (see the PEN
     option on the PLOT card).

3. CONTOUR         Refers to stress or displacement contour lines and values. 
                   If deformed plots are requested, then the contours will be 
                   drawn on the deformed shape. If an underlay is requested 
                   (via "O" in the subcase string), the contours will be drawn 
                   on the undeformed shape. 

4. i1, i2,...      Nonzero integers specifying the subcases that are to be 
                   plotted. Default is all subcases. See SHAPE and VECTOR for 
                   use of "O" (underlay) command. 

5. RANGE           Refers to range of eigenvalues (lambda1 - lambda2; real)

                   Formats 3, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 15), using requested 
                   subcases, for which plots will be prepared. 

TIME               Refers to time interval (t1 - t2; real), using requested 
                   subcases and output time steps, for which plots will be 
                   prepared (Rigid Formats 9 and 12). 

6. PHASE LAG       Real number, í, in degrees (default is 0.0). The plotted 
                   value is uR cos í - uI sin í, where uR and uI are the real 
                   and imaginary parts of the response quantity (Rigid Formats 
                   8 and 11). 

MAGNITUDE          Plotted value is square root of (uR2 + uI2).

7. MAXIMUM DEFORMATION  Real number d. The value dmax/d (where dmax is the
                   value specified on the MAXIMUM DEFORMATION card; see 
                   description) is used as the maximum displacement component 
                   in scaling the displacements for all subcases. Each subcase 
                   is scaled separately to the value dmax according to its own 
                   maximum if this item is absent. 

8. SET             Integer following (j) identifies a set which defines the 
                   portion of the structure to be plotted. Default is first 
                   set defined. 

9. ORIGIN          Integer following (k) identifies the origin to be used for 
                   the plot. Default is first origin defined. 

10. SYMMETRY w     Prepare an undeformed or deformed plot of the symmetric 
                   portion of the object which is defined by SET j. This 
                   symmetric portion will be located in the space adjacent to 
                   the region originally defined by ORIGIN k, and will appear 
                   as a reflection about the plane whose normal is oriented 
                   parallel to the coordinate direction w. 

ANTISYMMETRY w     Prepare a deformed plot of the symmetric portion of the 
                   antisymmetrically loaded object which is defined by SET j. 
                   This symmetric portion will be located in the space 
                   adjacent to the region originally defined by ORIGIN k, and 
                   will appear as a reflection of the antisymmetrically 
                   deformed structure about the plane whose normal is oriented 
                   parallel to the coordinate direction w. 

                   The symbol w may specify the basic coordinates X, Y, or Z 
                   or any combination thereof. This option allows the plotting 
                   of symmetric and/or antisymmetric combinations, provided 
                   that an origin is selected for the portion of the structure 
                   defined by the bulk data that allows sufficient room for 
                   the complete plot. This does not permit the combination of 
                   symmetric and antisymmetric subcases, as each plot must 
                   represent a single subcase. In the case of a double 
                   reflection, the figure will appear as one reflected about 
                   the plane whose normal is parallel to the first of the 
                   coordinates w, followed by a reflection about the plane 
                   whose normal is oriented parallel to the second of the 
                   coordinates w. This capability is primarily used in the 
                   plotting of structures that are loaded in a symmetric or an 
                   antisymmetric manner. The plane of symmetry must be one of 
                   the basic coordinate planes. 

                   In order to get both unreflected and reflected portions of 
                   a symmetric structure plotted on the same frame, the PLOT 
                   command must have two parts. The first part must contain 
                   instructions to plot a segment with a specified origin 
                   (biased to one side), but without the SYMMETRY or 
                   ANTISYMMETRY option; the second part following must contain 
                   instructions to plot the same segment with the same origin, 
                   but now with an appropriate choice of the SYMMETRY or 
                   ANTISYMMETRY option. See Example 6. 

11. PEN            Integer following (p) controls the internal NASTRAN pen 
                   number that is used to generate the plot on table and drum 
                   plotters. 

DENSITY            Integer following (p) specifies line density for microfilm
                   plotters. A line density of d is d times heavier than a line
                   density of 1.

12. SYMBOLS m[,n]  Each of the grid points associated with the specified set 
                   will have symbol m overprinted with symbol n printed at its 
                   location. If n is not specified, only symbol m will be 
                   printed. Grid points excluded from the set will not have a 
                   symbol. Grid points in an undeformed underlay will be 
                   identified with symbol 2. 

                   The following table gives the correspondence between the 
                   values of m and n and the symbols used in plotting. 

                        m or n      SYMBOL

                          0        no symbol
                          1            X
                          2            *
                          3            +
                          4            -
                          5        filled bullet
                          6        open circle
                          7        open square
                          8        open diamond
                          9        open triangle

13. LABEL GRID POINTS  All the grid points associated with the specified set 
                   have their identification number printed to the right of the
                   undeflected or deflected location (undeflected location for
                   superimposed plots).

LABEL ELEMENTS     All the elements included in the specified set are 
                   identified by the element identification number and type at 
                   the center of each element (undeflected location for 
                   superimposed plots). 

LABEL BOTH         Label both the grid points and elements.

                   Labels for element types are given in the following table:

                   Element Type     Plot Label     Element Type    Plot Label

LABEL EPID         All the elements included in the specified set are 
                   identified by the element property identification number 
                   (in addition to the element identification number and type) 
                   at the center of each element type (undeflected location 
                   for superimposed plots). Note that LABEL EPID causes 
                   element and property labels to be printed, but LABEL 
                   ELEMENT results only in element labels. 

14. SHAPE          All the elements included in the specified set are shown by 
                   connecting the associated grid points in a pre-determined 
                   manner. 

                   Both deformed and undeformed shapes may be specified. All 
                   of the deformed shapes relating to the subcases listed may 
                   be underlaid on each of their plots by including "O" with 
                   the subcase string on the PLOT card. The undeformed plot 
                   will be drawn using PEN 1 or DENSITY 1 and symbol 2 (if 
                   SYMBOLS is specified). 

15. VECTOR v       A line will be plotted at the grid points of the set, 
                   representing in length and direction the deformation of the 
                   point. 

                   Vectors representing the total deformation or its principal 
                   components may be plotted by insertion of the proper 
                   letter(s) for variable v. Possible vector combinations are: 

                   X or Y or Z requesting individual components

                   XY or XZ or YZ requesting two specified components

                   XYZ requesting all three components

                   RXY or RXZ or RYZ requesting vector sum of two components

                   R requesting total vector deformation

                   N used with any of the above combinations to request no 
                   underlay shape be drawn. 

                   All plots requesting the VECTOR option shall have an 
                   underlay generated of the undeformed shape using the same 
                   sets, PEN 1 or DENSITY 1, and symbol 2 (if SYMBOLS is 
                   specified). If SHAPE and VECTOR are specified, the underlay 
                   will depend on whether "O" is used with DEFORMATION. It 
                   will be the deformed shape when not used and will be both 
                   deformed and undeformed shapes when it is used. The part of 
                   the vector at the grid point will be the tail when the 
                   underlay is undeformed and the head when it is deformed. If 
                   the "N" parameter is used with VECTOR, no shape will be 
                   drawn but other options such as SYMBOLS will still be 
                   valid. 

16. OUTLINE        Connecting lines between grid points that lie on the 
                   boundary of the structural model will be plotted. The 
                   outline will reflect the deformed shape unless "O" is 
                   included in the subcase string. The OUTLINE option will be 
                   ignored if the CONTOUR option is not also requested. 

17. HIDDEN         Provides a hidden image plot of the elements in the plot 
                   set. The HIDDEN option will be ignored if the CONTOUR 
                   option is also requested. The LABEL option should not be 
                   used with the HIDDEN option. 

18. SHRINK s       The real value (s) is the factor used to shrink or reduce 
                   elements within connecting grid points. The value s is 
                   limited to 0.1 to 1.0 with a default value of 0.75. 

19. FILL           Provides the color filling of elements using the color 
                   specified by PEN. 

20. NOFIND         Disables the automatic FIND for this plot. That is, the SET 
                   defined for the present plot will be drawn using the SCALE, 
                   VANTAGE POINT, and ORIGIN from the previous PLOT command. 

21. OFFSET n       If OFFSET is not requested or n = 0, elements with offsets 
                   (CBAR, CQUAD4, and CTRIA3) will be plotted from and to the 
                   offsets (not from and to the grid point locations). Since 
                   the offsets are usually very small as compared to the bar 
                   lengths or the plate edges, the actual directions of the 
                   offsets are arbitrarily set (normally 90 degrees from bar 
                   or edge). If OFFSET n is requested and n > 0, only those 
                   elements which have offsets are plotted, the actual offset 
                   directions are computed, and the magnitudes of the offsets 
                   are amplified n times. Offset plot is available only in the 
                   undeformed plot. If n < 0, all elements will be plotted 
                   without the offsets, from and to the grid point locations. 
                   (Default n = 0.) 

Remarks

1.   The plot card is required to generate plots. Each logical card will cause
     one picture to be generated for each subcase, mode, or time step requested,
     using the current parameter values.

2.   If only the word PLOT appears on the card, a picture of the undeformed
     structure will be prepared using the first defined set and the first
     defined origin.

3.   If no FIND card is given after the previous PLOT card, the specified set on
     the PLOT card is used to perform an automatic FIND operation.

Examples

Following are some examples illustrating the use of the PLOT card:

1. PLOT

Undeformed SHAPE using first defined SET, first defined ORIGIN, and PEN 1 (or
DENSITY 1).

2. PLOT SET 3 ORIGIN 4 PEN 2 SHAPE SYMBOLS 3 LABEL

Undeformed SHAPE using SET 3, ORIGIN 4, PEN 2 (or DENSITY 2) with each grid
point of the set having a + placed at its location, and its identification
number printed adjacent to it.

3. PLOT MODAL DEFORMATION 5 SHAPE

Modal deformations as defined in subcase 5 using first defined SET, first
defined ORIGIN, and PEN 1 (or DENSITY 1). Subcases must have previously been
defined in the Case Control Deck via the use of MODES cards, otherwise all
modes will be in an assumed subcase 1.

4. PLOT STATIC DEFORMATION 0, 3 THRU 5, 8 PEN 4, SHAPE

Static deformations as defined in subcases 3, 4, 5, and 8, deformed SHAPE;
drawn with PEN 4, using first defined SET and ORIGIN, underlaid with
undeformed SHAPE drawn with PEN 1. This command will cause four plots to be
generated.

5. PLOT STATIC DEFORMATION 0 THRU 5,
   SET 2 ORIGIN 3 PEN 3 SHAPE,
   SET 2 ORIGIN 4 PEN 4 VECTORS XYZ SYMBOLS 6,
   SET 35 SHAPE

Deformations as defined in subcases 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, undeformed underlay
with PEN 1, consisting of SET 2 at ORIGIN 3, SET 2 at ORIGIN 4 (with an *
placed at each grid point location), and SET 35 at ORIGIN 4. Deflected data as
follows: SHAPE using SET 2 at ORIGIN 3 (PEN 3) and SET 35 at ORIGIN 4 (PEN 4);
3 VECTORS (X, Y, and Z) drawn at each grid point of SET 2 at ORIGIN 4 (PEN 4)
(less any excluded grid points), with open circle placed at the end of each
vector.

6. PLOT STATIC DEFORMATIONS 0, 3, 4,
   SET 1 ORIGIN 2 DENSITY 3 SHAPE,
   SET 1 SYMMETRY Z SHAPE,
   SET 2 ORIGIN 3 SHAPE,
   SET 2 SYMMETRY Z SHAPE

Static deformations as defined in subcases 3 and 4, both halves of a problem
solved by symmetry using the X-Y principal plane as the plane of symmetry. SET
1 at ORIGIN 2 and SET 2 at ORIGIN 3, with the deformed shape plotted using
DENSITY 3 and the undeformed structure plotted using DENSITY 1. The
deformations of the "opposite" half will be plotted to correspond to symmetric
loading. This command will cause two plots to be generated.

7. PLOT TRANSIENT DEFORMATION 1, TIME 0.1, 0.2, MAXIMUM DEFORMATION 2.0, SET 1,
   ORIGIN 1, PEN 2, SYMBOLS 2, VECTOR R

Transient deformations as defined in subcase 1 for time = 0.1 to time = 0.2,
using SET 1 at ORIGIN 1. The undeformed shape using PEN or DENSITY 1 with an *
at each grid point location will be drawn as an underlay for the resultant
deformation vectors using PEN or DENSITY 2 with an * typed at the end of each
vector drawn. In addition, a plotted value of dmax/2.0 (where dmax is the value
specified on the MAXIMUM DEFORMATION card) will be used for the single maximum
deformation occurring on any of the plots produced. All other deformations on
all other plots will be scaled relative to this single maximum deformation.
This command will cause a plot to be generated for each output time step which
lies between 0.1 and 0.2.

8. PLOT CMODAL DEFORMATION PHASE LAG 90., SET 1 VECTOR R

The imaginary part of the complex mode shape will be plotted for SET 1.

9. PLOT CONTOUR 2
   PLOT CONTOUR 2 OUTLINE
   CONTOUR MINPRIN
   PLOT STATIC DEFORMATION CONTOUR 1 OUTLINE

The first PLOT card will cause Major Principal Stress contours to be plotted
on the undeformed shape of the complete model and the second PLOT card will
cause the outline of the model to be plotted due to the defaults associated
with the CONTOUR card. Contour stress plots of the Minor Principal Stress will
be plotted on the outline of the deformed shape by the third PLOT card.

10. PLOT SET 10 SHRINK .85

The undeformed shape of the elements defined by SET 10 will be drawn, with
element sizes reduced to 85 percent of the scaled size. Grid locations will be
automatically scaled to fill the image area.

11. SET 10 = ALL
    SET 20 = 100 THRU 200
    FIND SCALE ORIGIN 1 SET 10
    PLOT SET 10
    PLOT SET 20 NOFIND
    PLOT SET 20

There will be three frames of the undeformed structure plotted. The first will
display the entire structure, scaled to fill the image area. The second frame
will display elements 100 through 200, using the scale for the previous plot.
The third frame will display elements 100 through 200, scaled to fill the
image area.

12. PLOT SET 10 PEN 6 FILL

The undeformed shape of the elements defined by SET 10 will be filled by the
color defined by PEN 6.

n                  Density of the plot tape in bits per inch (Integer > 0).

Remarks

1.   This card is optional. If it is used, it is recommended that it be the very
     first card after the OUTPUT(PLOT) card in the structure plot request
     packet.

2.   The tape density information is used only in the printout and does not
     control the density of the generated plot tape. To control the tape
     density, you must use the customary means of communication established at a
     given installation between you and the computer operators.

                   (for orthographic or perspective projections) or a smaller 
                   model (for stereoscopic projection; see below) in the units 
                   of the structural model; that is, one inch of paper equals 
                   one unit of the structure (Real). 

b                  Ratio by which the real object is first reduced to a 
                   smaller model before applying the scale factor a described 
                   above (Real). Used only in stereoscopic projections to 
                   enhance the stereoscopic effect.

1.   This card is optional, but is not recommended for general use. See the
     description of the FIND card in order to have the scale determined
     automatically.

2.   For stereoscopic projections, the ratio of the plotted object to the real
     object is given by the product a x b.

      ³ EXCEPT  ³ ³             ³
      À         Ù À             Ù

Option             Meaning

i                  Set identification number (Integer > 0).

j                  Element identification numbers (Integers > 0) or element 
                   types (BCD values). 

k                  Element identification numbers or grid point identification 
                   numbers (Integers > 0) or element types (BCD values). 

Remarks

1.   This card is required. However, when plotting in the substructure
     environment in Phase 2 (via the substructure PLOT command, see Section
     2.7.3), the set definition specified by this card is ignored.

2.   Multiple SET cards can be used to define multiple sets of elements, but
     redefinition of previously defined SETs is not permitted. Also, each SET
     must be one logical card and each SET identification number must be unique.

3.   ALL may be used to select all permissible element types. The following are
     the permissible element types:

     AERO1, AXIF2, AXIF3, AXIF4, BAR, CONEAX, CONROD, DUMi (i = 1-9), HBDY,
     HEXA1, HEXA2, FLUID2, FLUID3, FLUID4, IHEX1, IHEX2, IHEX3, PLOTEL, QDMEM,
     QDMEM1, QDMEM2, QDPLT, QUAD1, QUAD2, ROD, SHEAR, SLOT3, SLOT4, TETRA,
     TORDRG, TRAPAX, TRAPRG, TRBSC, TRIAAX, TRIARG, TRIA1, TRIA2, TRIM6, TRMEM,
     TRPLT, TRPLT1, TRSHL, TUBE, TWIST, VISC, WEDGE.

4.   INCLUDE may be used at any time for element information. When used with
     grid points, INCLUDE can be used only to restore previously EXCLUDEd grid
     points. It cannot be used to include grid points in the original set of
     grid points.

5.   EXCLUDE can be used to delete elements or element types. All grid points
     that are associated with deleted elements are also deleted. EXCLUDE can be
     used to delete deformation vectors from grid points enumerated after an
     EXCLUDE command.

6.   EXCEPT is a modifier to an INCLUDE or an EXCLUDE statement.

7.   THRU is used to indicate all of the integers in a sequence of
     identification numbers, starting with the integer preceding THRU and ending
     with the integer following THRU. The integers in the range of the THRU
     statement need not be consecutive; for example, the sequence 2, 4, 7, 9 may
     be specified as 2 THRU 9.

8.   Each set of elements defines by implication a set of grid points connected
     by those elements. The set may be modified by deleting some of its grid
     points. The elements are used for creating the plot itself and element
     labeling, and the grid points are used for labeling, symbol printing, and
     drawing deformation vectors.

9.   It should be noted that only elements can be plotted. Grid points not
     associated with elements cannot be plotted. Grid points may be connected
     with PLOTEL elements for plotting purposes.

10.  When using axisymmetric (CONEAX, TRAPAX, or TRIAAX) or fluid (FLUID2,
     FLUID3, or FLUID4) elements, the element and grid point identification
     numbers specified on the SET card must refer to the NASTRAN (or
     internal) identification numbers rather than to your (or external)
     identification numbers. The relationships between these two sets of
     identification numbers are given in Section 1.3.7.3 for the axisymmetric
     elements and in Section 1.7.1.4 for the fluid elements.

Examples

The sets of identification numbers can be assembled by use of the word ALL, or
by individually listing the integers in any order, such as 1065, 32, 46, 47,
7020, or by listing sequences using THRU, EXCLUDE, and EXCEPT, such as 100
THRU 1000 EXCEPT 182 EXCLUDE 877 THRU 911. Following are some examples of SET
cards:

1. SET 1 INCLUDE 1, 5, 10 THRU 15 EXCEPT 12

Set will consist of elements 1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15.

2. SET 25 = ROD, CONROD, EXCEPT 21

Set will consist of all ROD and CONROD elements except element 21.

3. SET 10 SHEAR EXCLUDE GRID POINTS 20, 30 THRU 60, EXCEPT 35, 36 INCLUDE
   ELEMENTS 70 THRU 80

This set will include all SHEAR elements plus elements 70 through 80, and the
associated grid point set will contain all grid points connected by these
elements. Grid points 20, 30 through 34, and 37 through 60 will appear on all
plots with their symbols and labels; however, no deformation vectors will
appear at these grid points when VECTOR is commanded.

4. SET (15) = (15 THRU 100) EXCEPT (21 THRU 25)

This set will include all elements from 15 to 20 and from 26 to 100.

5. SET 2 = ALL EXCEPT BAR

This set will include all elements except BARs.

NOTE: The equal signs, commas, and parentheses above are delimiters and are
not required because blanks also serve as delimiters.

Remarks

1.   This card is optional. It is applicable only for perspective and
     stereoscopic projections. See Figure 4.2-3 and the discussion in Section
     4.2.1.

2.   This card is not recommended for general use. See the description of the

à                  Angle of orientation (degrees) (Real). See Figure 4.2-1.

Remarks

1.   This card is optional.

2.   The default value for á is 23.17 degrees for orthographic and perspective
     projections and 0.0 degrees for stereoscopic projections.

3.   The order in which ç, á, and à are specified is critically important as
     illustrated in Figure 4.2-3. See also Section 13.1.1 of the Theoretical
     Manual.

4.   By proper use of the AXES card (see description), any desired orientation
     can be obtained by the VIEW card by specifying rotations that are all less
     than 90.0 degrees.

4.2.3 Error Messages

The structure plotting software in NASTRAN contains messages related to plot
requests that are not in the same format as the other diagnostic messages
described in Section 6. These messages are warnings and notify you that the
erroneous plot requests are being ignored. Only legitimate plot requests, if
any, will be honored.

The messages and their meanings are as follows:

1. NO PLOTTABLE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS EXIST IN SET ********.

This message is issued when a SET contains elements that are not permitted as
described in Section 4.2.2.4. If a SET has some elements that are plottable
and some that are not, the message is not issued and the resulting plot
contains only the plottable elements.

2. ALL REFERENCES TO SET ******** WILL DEFAULT TO FIRST SET DEFINED.

This message is issued when a SET referenced on a PLOT card either does not
exist or has been eliminated previously due to another error.

3. REFERENCE TO SET ******** ON FIND CARD WILL DEFAULT TO FIRST DEFINED SET.

This message is issued when a SET referenced on a FIND card either does not
exist or has been eliminated previously due to another error.

4. MAXIMUM DEFORMATION CARD NEEDED - 5 PER CENT OF MAXIMUM DIMENSION USED.

This message is issued when the MAXIMUM DEFORMATION card is not positioned
properly in the plot request package or has not been defined.

5. AN UNRECOGNIZABLE OPTION (********) WAS DETECTED ON A -PLOT- CARD.

This message is issued when illegal, out of sequence, or misspelled options
appear on a PLOT card. The plot will be prepared, if possible, from the
remaining information.

6. A NON-EXISTENT ORIGIN (********) HAS BEEN SPECIFIED ON A -PLOT- CARD.

This message is issued when an ORIGIN has not been defined or has been
previously eliminated by another error.

7. A NON-EXISTENT SET (********) HAS BEEN SPECIFIED ON A -PLOT- CARD.

This message is issued when a SET has not been defined or has been previously
eliminated by another error.

8. THE -****- PLOT FILE HAS NOT BEEN SET UP...PLOT CARD IGNORED

This message is issued when the plot file has not been assigned to tape or
disk. No plots are possible.

9. INSUFFICIENT CORE FOR SET (********). CORE AVAILABLE = ********, NEEDED =
********.

This message is issued when insufficient core is available to process the SET
defined. Either increase the core or reduce the size of the SET to subSETs.

10. *** A PLOT NOT ATTEMPTED DUE TO INPUT OR FILE ***

This message is issued when a PLOT command contradicts Case Control. For
example, requesting plots for a SUBCASE, EIGENVALUE, LOAD, TIME, or FREQUENCY
that does not exist would be contradictory. No plots are possible.

11. *** INCOMPLETE PLOT DUE TO INPUT OR FILE ***.

This message is issued for the same reasons as in the preceding message,
except some plotting is possible because not all plot requests are
contradictory.

12. NO STRESS CALCULATION FOUND FOR ELEMENT NUMBER ******** ELEMENT IGNORED.

This message is issued when a STRESS contour plot is requested but STRESS
computations were not requested in Case Control.

13. MORE THAN 50 CONTOURS SPECIFIED *** REJECTED.

This message is issued for all contour plot requests beginning with the
fifty-first request.

14. AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO DEFINE MORE THAN *** DISTINCT ORIGINS.

15. AN UNRECOGNIZABLE PLOT PARAMETER HAS BEEN DETECTED - IGNORED.

4.3  X-Y PLOTTER OUTPUT

   In rigid formats used for transient response, frequency response (including
random response), modal flutter analysis and modal aeroelastic response, the
amount of output data generated is voluminous. In order to aid you in
assimilating this vast amount of data, the X-Y output processing modules
XYTRAN and XYPLOT have been provided. The primary purpose of these modules is
to generate plotted graphs of y(x) where x is frequency, time, or velocity and
y is any response quantity you select for observation. These modules also
provide for the plotting of any response quantity you select versus subcase in
static analysis (Rigid Format 1). You are not required to specify any
parametric data for the X-Y plotter; however, you may do so if you wish in
order to obtain desired scales, regions of observation, etc.

   In addition to (or in place of) the plots, X-Y tabular output may be
printed or punched, and summary data (for example, maximum and minimum values
and locations of these values) may be obtained for any X-Y output. There is
also provision to generate X-Y plots within the printed output.

   The X-Y output described above you can obtain via the X-Y output request
packet of the Case Control Deck. This packet includes all cards between
OUTPUT(XYPLOT) or (XYOUT) and either BEGIN BULK or OUTPUT(PLOT). The remainder
of this section describes the X-Y output request data cards and the rules for
writing them. Examples are provided to illustrate the use of this feature.

4.3.1  X-Y Plotter Terminology

   A single set of plotted X-Y pairs is known as a "curve". Curves are the
entities that you request to be plotted. The surface (paper, microfilm frame,
etc.) on which one or more curves is plotted is known as a "frame". Curves may
be plotted on a whole frame, an upper half frame, or a lower half frame. You
may choose grid lines, tic marks, axes, axis labeling, and other graphic
control items. The program will select defaults for parameters that you do not
select.

4.3.2  X-Y Output Request Packet Data

4.3.2.1  Summary of Data Cards

   Only two cards are required for an X-Y output request. These are:

   1. X-Y output request packet identifier - OUTPUT(XYPLOT) or OUTPUT(XYOUT).

   2. At least one command operation card.

The terms OUTPUT(XYPLOT) and OUTPUT(XYOUT) are interchangeable and either form
may be used for any of the X-Y output requests. A plotter selection card is
required only if plots are desired and the plotter is other than the default
plotter (microfilm plotter without typing capability). The command operation
cards are used to request the various forms of X-Y output. For the sake of
convenience and completeness, all command operation cards are described
together under the description of the XYPLOT data card in Section 4.3.2.5.

   If only the required cards are used, the graphic control items will all
assume default values. Curves using all default parameters have the following
general characteristics:

   1. Tic marks are drawn on all edges of the frame. Five spaces are provided
      on each edge of the frame.

   2. All tic marks are labeled with their values.

   3. Linear scales are used.

   4. Scales are selected such that all points fall within the frame.

   5. The plotted points are connected with straight lines.

   6. The plotted points are not identified with symbols.

The above characteristics may be modified by inserting any of the parameter
definition cards, described in Section 4.3.2.5, ahead of the command operation
card or cards. The use of a parameter definition card sets the value of that
parameter for all following command operation cards unless the CLEAR card is
inserted. (Because of its impact, you should be very careful in the use of the
CLEAR card. See its description for details.) If grid lines are requested,
they will be drawn at the locations of all tic marks that result from defaults
or your request. You cannont select the locations of tic marks (or grid lines)
for logarithmic scales. Default values for logarithmic spacing are selected by
the program. The default values for the number of tic marks (or grid lines)
per cycle depend on the number of logarithmic cycles required for the range of
the plotted values.

   A summary of the data cards is given in Table 4.3-1.

4.3.2.2  Tic Marks in Plots

   Tic marks on any edge can be selected by the use of the appropriate "TICS"
parameter cards (UPPER TICS, LOWER TICS, LEFT TICS, RIGHT TICS, TLEFT TICS,
TRIGHT TICS, BLEFT TICS and BRIGHT TICS). Thus, on any edge, you can select
any one of the following options:

   1. Tic marks to be drawn without values

   2. No tic marks or values to be drawn

   3. Tic marks to be drawn with values

   However, it is very important to note that the results yielded by the use
of the above mentioned "TICS" cards may be altered when they are used in
conjunction with ALL EDGE TICS, TALL EDGE TICS, or BALL EDGE TICS cards.
Noting that the tic values input may only be -1, 0, or 1, the net result of
the use of various "TICS" cards may be determined by the following procedure:

      Add the tic integer value of the edge in question to its associated ALL
      EDGE TICS, TALL EDGE TICS, or BALL EDGE TICS integer value. Let the
      resulting value be termed "ticsum". Then we have the following:

      If ticsum < 0,  tic marks will be drawn without values.
      If ticsum = 0,  no tic marks or values will be drawn.
      If ticsum > 0,  tic marks will be drawn with values.

   You should therefore be careful in your use of the ALL EDGE TICS, TALL EDGE
TICS, or BALL EDGE TICS cards. Thus, the use of only the ALL EDGE TICS = -1
card will result in no tic marks or values being drawn since the default
values for individual edge tic cards are all +1.

same as those described in Section 4.2.2.3 for structure plot data cards.
There is, however, an important addition to the manner in which an X-Y output
command operation card can be continued: if continuation cards are needed in
the case of the command operation cards, the previous card must be terminated
either by a slash (/) or by a comma.

4.3.2.5  Data Card Descriptions

   All of the X-Y output data cards are described on the following pages. The
descriptions are arranged in alphabetical order by the card names. The general
form for each card is shown. The description of the card contents then
follows. An example of each card usage is given immediately below general
form, except in the case of the XYPLOT card, where the examples follow the
description of the card.

XYPLOT     Generate one or more frames of X-Y plots on the selected plotter
           using the current parameter specifications.

XYPRINT    Generate tabular printer output for the X-Y pairs. See also Remark
           2.

XYPUNCH    Generate punched card output for the X-Y pairs. Each card contains
           the following information:

           1. X-Y pair sequence number
           2. X-value
           3. Y-value
           4. Card sequence number

XYPEAK     Output is limited to the printed summary page for each curve. This
           summary page contains the maximum and minimum values of y for the
           range of x.

XYPAPLOT   Generate X-Y plots within the printed output. This is a capability
           to provide minimum output for the purpose of observing general
           curve behavior. Many of the detailed specifications described
           elsewhere in this section are not supported. This feature is
           limited to producing Cartesian plots with titles, overall scales,
           and data point locations. When the paper is rotated 90 degrees for
           viewing the paper plots, the X-axis moves horizontally along the
           page and the Y-axis moves vertically along the page. Symbol "*"
           identifies the points associated with the first curve of a frame,
           then for successive curves on the same frame, the points are
           designated by the symbols "0", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G",
           and "H".

Curve Type

ACCE       Acceleration in the physical set.

DISP       Displacement in the physical set.

ELFORCE    Element force.

ELSTRESS   Element stress.

FORCE      Element force (same as ELFORCE).

LOAD       Load.

NONLINEAR  Nonlinear load.

OLOAD      Load (same as LOAD).

SACCE      Acceleration in the solution set.

SDISP      Displacement in the solution set.

SPCF       Single-point force of constraint.

STRESS     Element stress (same as ELSTRESS).

SVELO      Velocity in the solution set.

VECTOR     Displacement in the physical set (same as DISP).

VELO       Velocity in the physical set.

VG         Flutter analysis curves.

           Solution set requests are more efficient, as the time-consuming
           recovery of the dependent displacements can be avoided. However,
           if there is a request for ELSTRESS (or STRESS) or ELFORCE (or
           FORCE), the recovery of dependent displacements cannot be avoided.

Plot Type

RESPONSE   Generate output for static analysis, frequency response or
           transient response. This is the default value.

AUTO       Generate output for the autocorrelation function.

PSDF       Generate output for the power spectral density function.

Subcase List

i1, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6, etc. Generate output for the subcase numbers that are 
           listed. The subcase list must be in ascending order. The default
           is all subcases for which solutions were obtained.

Curve Request(s)

"frames"   The word "frames" represents a series of curve identifiers of the
           following general form:

           /a1(b1,c1),a2(b2,c2),etc./d1(e1,f1),d2(e2,f2),etc./etc.

           The information following each slash (/) specifies curves that are
           to be drawn on the same frame. For all plots except the VG plot,
           the symbol a1 identifies the grid point or element number
           associated with the first curve on the first frame. The symbol a2
           identifies the grid point or element number associated with the
           second curve on the first frame. The symbols d1 and d2 identify
           similar items for curves on the second frame, etc. For any
           particular frame, the symbols must be assigned in ascending order
           by grid point or element identification number and item code. For
           VG plots, the symbols a1, a2, etc., refer to the loop count of the
           flutter analysis.

           The symbols b1 and b2 are codes for the components to be plotted
           on the upper half of the first frame, and c1 and c2 are codes for
           the components to be plotted on the lower half of the first frame.
           If any of the symbols b1, c1, b2, or c2 are missing, the
           corresponding curve is not generated. If the comma (,) and c1 are
           absent along with the comma (,) and c2, full frame plots will be
           prepared on the first frame for the components represented by b1
           and b2. For any single frame, curve identifiers must be all of the
           whole frame type or all of the half frame type; that is, the comma
           (,) following b1 and b2 must be present for all entries or absent
           for all entries in a single frame. The symbols e1, f1, e2, and f2
           serve a similar purpose for the second frame, etc.  If
           continuation cards are needed, the previous card must be
           terminated either with a slash (/) or a comma (,) as indicated in
           Section 4.3.2.4.

           For VG plots, the component codes (b1, b2, etc. and c1, c2, etc.)
           may have the values F (for frequency) or G (for damping). For all
           other plots, the manner in which the component code is implemented
           is dependent upon whether the plot type is (a) RESPONSE or (b)
           AUTO or PSDF. This is described below.

           Component Codes for Plot Type RESPONSE

           For geometric grid points, the component code is one of the
           mnemonics T1, T2, T3, R1, R2, R3, T1RM, T2RM, T3RM, R1RM, R2RM,
           R3RM, T1IP, T2IP, T3IP, R1IP, R2IP, or R3IP, where Ti stands for
           the ith translational component, Ri stands for the ith rotational
           component, and RM means real or magnitude and IP means imaginary
           or phase. For scalar or extra points, use T1, T1RM, or T1IP. (See
           Remark 2 below for the interpretation of component codes for
           geometric grid, scalar, and extra points in the printed X-Y
           output.) For elements, use a positive integer from the following
           tables for element stress component codes (Table 4.3-2) or element
           force component codes (Table 4.3-3). (See Section 1.3 for the
           interpretation of the symbols used in Tables 2 and 3 for element
           stress and force components.)

           Component Codes for Plot Type AUTO or PSDF

           For geometric grid points, the component code is one of the
           mnemonics T1, T2, T3, R1, R2, or R3; for scalar or extra points
           use T1. The symbols T1, T2, T3, R1, R2, and R3 are defined as
           above. (See Remark 2 below for the interpretation of component
           codes for geometric grid, scalar, and extra points in the printed
           XY output.) For elements, use a positive integer from the
           following tables, noting that if a component has a real and an
           imaginary part, the selection of either part will result in the
           use of both the parts. Real numbers in the output will be treated
           as if they are complex numbers with zero imaginary parts. Split
           frames cannot be used for AUTO or PSDF plots.
Remarks

1. At least one command operation card (XYPLOT, XYPRINT, XYPUNCH, XYPEAK or
   XYPAPLOT) must appear in an X-Y output packet request.

2. In the printed X-Y output, the component codes shown for the geometric
   grid, scalar, or extra points are not the same as the mnemonics input on
   the command operation cards. Instead, the component codes are identified by
   integers as indicated by the following table.

   Scalar and Extra Points in Printed X-Y Output

Examples

Following are some examples illustrating the use of X-Y output command
operation cards. The BEGIN BULK or OUTPUT(PLOT) card is shown as a reminder to
you to place your X-Y output request packet properly in your Case Control
Deck, that is, at the end of the Case Control Deck or just ahead of any
structure plot requests. You must ensure that file PLT2 is set up for plotting
use via system control cards to use a tape or mass storage area.

Example 1

OUTPUT(XYPLOT)
XYPLOT SDISP / 16(T1)
BEGIN BULK

Causes a single whole frame to be plotted for the T1 displacement component of
solution set point 16 using the default parameter values. If 16(T1) is not in
the solution set, a warning message will be printed and no plot will be made.
Since there is no PLOTTER card, the plot will be generated, by default, for a
microfilm plotter without typing capability.

Example 2

OUTPUT(XYOUT)
PLOTTER = NASTPLT D, 1
XYPLOT, XYPRINT VELO RESPONSE 1,5 / 3(R1, ), 5( ,R1)

Causes a single frame (consisting of an upper half frame and a lower half
frame) to be plotted using the default parameter values. The velocity of the
first rotational component of grid point 3 will be plotted on the upper half
frame and that of grid point 5 will be plotted on the lower half frame for
subcases 1 and 5. Tabular printer output will also be generated for both
curves. The plots will be generated for a drum plotter without typing
capability. Scales will be selected such that the frame will fit on 30 x
30-inch paper.

Example 3

OUTPUT(XYPLOT)
PLOTTER = NASTPLT T, 0
YDIVISIONS = 20
XDIVISIONS = 10
XGRID LINES = YES
YGRID LINES = YES
XYPLOT DISP 2,5 /10(T1),10(T3)

Causes two whole frame plots to be generated, one for subcase 2 and one for
subcase 5. Each plot contains the T1 and T3 displacement components for grid
point 10. The default parameters will be modified to include grid lines in
both the X- and Y-directions with 10 spaces in the X-direction and 20 spaces
in the Y-direction. The plot will be generated for a table plotter with typing
capability.

Example 4

OUTPUT(XYPLOT)
PLOTTER = NASTPLT T, 1
XAXIS = YES
YAXIS = YES
XPAPER = 17.0
YPAPER = 22.0
XYPLOT STRESS 3/ 15(2)/ 21(6)

Causes two whole frame plots to be generated using the results from subcase 3.
The first plot is the response of the axial stress for rod (ROD) element
number 15. The second plot is the response of the major principal stress for
triangular membrane (TRMEM) element number 21. The default parameters will be
modified to include the X-axis and Y-axis drawn through the origin. Each plot
will be scaled to fit on 17 x 22 inch paper. The plots will be generated for a
table plotter without typing capability.

Example 5

OUTPUT(XYPLOT)
PLOTTER = NASTPLT D,0
CURVELINESYMBOL = -1
XYPLOT VG / 1(G,F), 2(G,F), 3(G,F), 4(G,F)

A split frame plot will be made; the upper half is V-g and the lower half is
V-f. Data from the first four loops will be plotted. Distinct symbols will be
used for data from each loop, and no lines will be drawn between points (since
the flutter analyst must sometimes exercise judgement about which points
should be connected). The plots will be generated for a drum plotter with
typing capability.

4.4  NASTRAN GENERAL PURPOSE PLOTTER (NASTPLT) FILE

   As indicated in Section 4.1, the NASTRAN plotting software is completely
independent of any particular plotting hardware. This protects the NASTRAN
software from being impacted by changes, additions, or deletions made to any
particular plotting hardware. Instead, the plot file produced by NASTRAN
(which may reside either on physical tape or on a mass storage device) is
meant for a hypothetical plotter termed the NASTRAN General Purpose Plotter
(NASTPLT) and is not suitable for use directly by any particular plotter. In
order to use this NASTPLT file to obtain plots on any particular plotter, your
installation must have available an external translator program to interpret
this plot file and create plots on the plotter. Thus, in order to obtain plots
using NASTRAN, two programs must be run: first, NASTRAN itself, to generate
the NASTPLT file; and then the external translator program, to interpret this
plot file.

   The purpose of this section is to explain the characteristics and
construction of the NASTPLT file, so that you or a programmer will be able to
write a program to translate this plot file for your plotter. Understanding
the overall logic used by the NASTRAN plotter software package in producing a
plot file will simplify the task of writing this translator program. It is
therefore recommended that you or the programmer familiarize yourself not only
with this section, but also with Section 6.10 of the Programmer's Manual,
dealing with the plotting software in NASTRAN.

   The NASTPLT file is composed of a simple set of elementary plot operations,
which can be easily deciphered by a FORTRAN program on any digital computer.
As each operation is deciphered, the translator program should direct the
receiving plotter to appropriate action. This would normally be done by using
the installation software to interface between the translator program and the
receiving plotter. If appropriate external translator programs are written, it
is thus possible to obtain NASTRAN plots on any plotter.

4.4.1  Description of the NASTPLT File

   The NASTPLT file is a fixed-length-record file. An end-of-file mark follows
the last plot only. Each record of the file is composed of 3000 n-bit bytes
(or characters), each byte (or character) containing an unsigned integer. The
value of n (the number of bits per byte) depends on the machine type. On the
CDC and UNIVAC versions, n is equal to 6; on the IBM and DEC VAX versions, n
is equal to 8. Thus, each record of 3000 unsigned integers consists of 300
words on the CDC (where the word length is 60 bits), 500 words on the UNIVAC
(word length: 36 bits) and 750 words on the IBM and DEC VAX (word length: 32
bits).

   Each record of the NASTPLT file is composed of 100 plot commands, each
command being composed of 30 bytes or unsigned integers (3 words on the CDC, 5
words on the UNIVAC, and 15 half-words on the IBM and DEC VAX). Not all plot
commands will have useful information in all 30 bytes. Some commands use only
two of the 30 bytes, while others use 22. The general format of each command
is as follows:

   PCR R R R R S S S S S T T T T T U U U U U 000000-
      4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0
   00

where:

   P  = plot command
   C  = control index
   Ri = decimal digit of an integer called R
   Si = decimal digit of an integer called S
   Ti = decimal digit of an integer called T
   Ui = decimal digit of an integer called U
   0 = zero

   The plot command is an n-bit integer, any one of seven (7) possible plot
commands, as follows:

   0 = no operation
   1 = start new plot
   2 = select camera
   3 = skip to a new frame
   4 = type a character (may also = 14)
   5 = draw a line (may also = 15)
   6 = draw an axis (may also = 16)

The control index is also an n-bit integer. It may be a pen number (or a color
fill option), a line density, a camera number, or a pointer into a list of
characters and symbols. The four integer values (R, S, T, U) specified in a
command must be reconstructed by the external translator program. Each integer
value is represented in the command as follows:

   d d d d d
    4 3 2 1 0

where the original integer value is given by:

       4         3         2        1         0
   d 10   +  d 10   +  d 10  +  d 10   +  d 10
    4         3         2        1         0

The significance of each of the four integer values (R, S, T, U) may vary from
one plot command to another. This is discussed in the next section.

4.4.2  Description of the Plot Commands on the NASTPLT File

   The seven possible plot commands on the NASTPLT file are described here.

   The no-operation (0) command is simply a padding for plot records which may
otherwise have been less than 300 bytes long. All 30 bytes of this command
will be zero.

   The start-new-plot (1) command will always be the first command introducing
each new plot. The first integer (R) is the plot number. The second and third
integers (S and T) are the maximum x and y values specified in any other
command for this plot. The minimum x and y values are always zero and are
therefore not specified in the start-new-plot command. If necessary, the
translator program can use these maximum x and y values to scale subsequent
integer values so that the plot will not exceed the limits of the plotting
surface. The plot number is included because some plotters require the plot
number as part of the first command for each new plot. In addition, if the
receiving plotter is a table plotter, the translator program should issue a
command to the plotter which will stop it so that the plotter operator can
change the paper. If the plotter is a drum plotter, the translator program
must skip a sufficient amount of paper to ensure that the previous plot will
not be over-plotted. And if the receiving plotter is a microfilm plotter,
nothing else need be done.

   The select-camera (2) command uses only the control index (C). The
remaining 28 bytes are always zeros. This command is meaningful only on a
microfilm plotter having both film and hardcopy output. The control index is
the camera or output medium request number: 1 = film only, 2 = hardcopy
(paper) only, and 3 = both. Upon receiving this command, the translator
program should issue a command to the receiving plotter selecting the
requested camera or output medium, then this command should be ignored.

   The skip-to-a-new-frame (3) command also uses only the control index. The
remaining 28 bytes are always zeros. This command is meaningful only on a
microfilm plotter. The control index is the camera or output medium request
number: 1 = film only, 2 = hardcopy (paper) only, and 3 = both. The
appropriate camera will have already been selected in a previous select-camera
command. The only reason the camera number is included in this command is that
some microfilm plotters require the camera or output medium to be specified in
both select-camera and skip-frame commands. Upon receiving this command, the
translator program should issue a command to the receiving plotter to skip to
a new frame. If the receiving plotter is not a microfilm plotter, then this
command should be ignored. Note: At least one skip-to-a-new-frame command will
appear after each start-new-plot command and before the next start-new-plot
command.

   The type-character (4), draw-line (5), and draw-axis (6) commands will
always occur in sets, that is, a set of type-character commands, a set of
draw-line commands, a set of draw-axis commands. There may be more than one
set of each type of command, but, within a set, the commands will all be of
the same type. This is done because on some plotters it is very inefficient to
frequently change modes (for example, typing mode, line drawing mode) of
operation. The plot command of the first command in a set will always = 10 +
the basic plot command value, that is, type-character = 14; draw-line = 15;
and draw-axis = 16. In all subsequent plot commands in the set, the plot
command value will always equal the basic plot command value.

   For a type-character command, the control index is a pointer into a
specific list of characters and special symbols. The list of characters and
symbols to which the pointer applies is given in Table 4.4-1. The first two
integer values (R and S) in the plot command represent the x and y coordinates
of the point on the plotting surface at which the center of the character or
symbol should be typed. The next integer value (T) represents the character
scale value (see the description of the CSCALE card in Section 4.2.2.4) to be
used in the plotting. The remaining 13 bytes of the command are always zeros.
Upon receipt of a type-character command, the translator program should issue
a command to the receiving plotter to type the requested character or special
symbol (using the CSCALE value, if possible and appropriate) at the specified
point. Of course, there is no guarantee that all the possible characters and
special symbols can be typed by the receiving plotter. If any character or
special symbol cannot be typed by the receiving plotter, the translator
program will then have to make a substitution or not type the character at
all.

   For a draw-line command, the control index is either a pen number or a
color fill option (for table and drum plotters) or a line density (for
microfilm plotters). If the receiving plotter is a microfilm plotter, it is
recommended that the translator program simply draw the line as many times as
is indicated by the line density value, rather than using any special density
settings available on the plotter hardware.

   For table and drum plotters, the control index of the draw-line command
denotes a pen number if the index has values between 1 and 31, both inclusive
(that is, 1 <=  control index <= 31). Control index values above 31 (up to 61)
and a value of 0 represent the color fill option of closed polygons. The color
filling of an n-sided closed polygon consists of a series of n draw-line
commands, each in turn corresponding to one side of the polygon. All but the
last of the draw-line commands in the series have the same control index
value, m (31 < m <= 61). The last draw-line command in the series has a
control index value of 0, indicating the last side of the closed polygon. The
color with which the polygon is to be filled is given by pen number (m - 31).

   The first two integer values (R and S) of the draw-line command represent
the x and y coordinates of the starting point of the line. The next two
integer values (T and U) represent the x and y coordinates of the ending point
of the line. The last 8 bytes of the command are always zeros. Upon receipt of
this command, the translator program should issue a command to the receiving
plotter to draw the line. NOTE: Some plotters require that a line be broken
into a series of short lines. If this is the case on the receiving plotter,
the translator program will have to accomplish this task unless the
installation software makes provision for this automatically.

   The draw-axis command is identical to the draw-line command, except that
there is no color fill option as it is not meaningful in this case. The only
other difference is in the orientation of the drawn line. The line drawn by a
draw-axis command will always be either horizontal or vertical. For most
plotters, the translator program will handle this command just like a
draw-line command. However, some plotters, which would ordinarily require that
lines be broken into a series of short lines, may have a special command
available to draw a horizontal or vertical line of any length. Only for these
few plotters will this command have any special significance in the translator
program. If such is the situation, the translator program, upon receipt of
this command, should issue a command to the receiving plotter to draw the
axis. Otherwise, the translator program should simply issue a command to the
receiving plotter to draw a line representing the axis.
